(Compositae) showed potent antiproliferative activity against B cell hybridoma cell, MH60. By bioassay-guided purification, a new lignan, (+)-7,8-didehydroarctigenin, together with the known lignans (-)-arctigenin and (-)-matairesinol were isolated as the active ingredients from an aqueous ethanolic extract of the fruits of A. lappa. Of these active compounds, (-)-arctigenin showed the most potent anti proliferative activity against MH60 cells (IC50: 1.0 mu M), and the activity was suggested to be due to apoptosis.","Kitasato Univ, Kitasato Inst Life Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088641, Japan; Kitasato Inst, Grad Sch Infect Control Sci, Tokyo 108, Japan; Kitasato Inst, Oriental Med Res Ctr, Tokyo 108, Japan",,"Yamada, H (corresponding author), Kitasato Univ, Kitasato Inst Life Sci, Minato Ku, 5-9-1 Shirokane, Tokyo 1088641, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,yamada@lisci.kitasato-u.ac.jp,"liang, xu/A-2138-2012",,,,9,76,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0032-0943,1439-0221,FEB,2006,72,3,10.1055/s-2005-916174,"Plant Sciences; Chemistry, Medicinal; Integrative & Complementary Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",025PO,WOS:000236279400017,16534737,,

Members of Gossypium produce subepidermal pigment glands in their leaves that contain the dimeric sesquiterpenoid gossypol as well as other biosynthetically related terpenoids. In addition to gossypol, a previously unknown dimeric sesquiterpenoid, gossypolhemiquinone (GHQ), was identified in trace amounts in G. thurberi, a member of the D genome. Other members of the D genome of Gossypium were subsequently found to contain this compound, but GHQ was not detected in commercial cotton cultivars. When fed to Helicoverpa zea in an artificial diet, GHQ delayed days -to -pupation, reduced pupal weights, and survival to adulthood to a lesser or equal extent than gossypol in comparison to the control diet. However, GHQ had a synergistic effect on survival and days -to -pupation when combined with gossypol at the highest dosage tested (0.18%; 15.5:84.5 GHQ:gossypol). Because gossypol exhibits anticancer activity, GHQ was also evaluated for its anti -cancer activity against the National Cancer Institute's 60 -Human Tumor Cell Line Screen. Significant inhibitory activity against most of these cell lines was not observed, but the results may offer some promise against leukemia cancer cell lines.

However, little is known about these correlations in rice (Oryza sativa 'Nipponbare'), despite its importance as a model monocot. We performed an integrated analysis to clarify the relationships among cold- and dehydration-responsive metabolites, phytohormones, and gene transcription in rice. An integrated analysis of metabolites and gene expression indicated that several genes encoding enzymes involved in starch degradation, sucrose metabolism, and the glyoxylate cycle are up-regulated in rice plants exposed to cold or dehydration and that these changes are correlated with the accumulation of glucose (Glc), fructose, and sucrose. In particular, high expression levels of genes encoding isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in the glyoxylate cycle correlate with increased Glc levels in rice, but not in Arabidopsis, under dehydration conditions, indicating that the regulation of the glyoxylate cycle may be involved in Glc accumulation under dehydration conditions in rice but not Arabidopsis. An integrated analysis of phytohormones and gene transcripts revealed an inverse relationship between abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and cytokinin (CK) signaling under cold and dehydration stresses; these stresses increase ABA signaling and decrease CK signaling. High levels of Oryza sativa 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase transcripts correlate with ABA accumulation, and low levels of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 735A transcripts correlate with decreased levels of a CK precursor in rice. This reduced expression of CYP735As occurs in rice but not Arabidopsis. Therefore, transcriptional regulation of CYP735As might be involved in regulating CK levels under cold and dehydration conditions in rice but not Arabidopsis.","[Maruyama, Kyonoshin; Yoshiwara, Kyouko; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, Kazuko] Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, Biol Resources & Postharvest Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan; [Urano, Kaoru; Sakurai, Nozomu; Shibata, Daisuke] RIKEN, Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Gene Discovery Res Grp, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan; [Morishita, Yoshihiko; Sakurai, Nozomu; Suzuki, Hideyuki; Shibata, Daisuke] Kazusa DNA Res Inst, Dept Biotechnol Res, Kisarazu, Chiba 2920818, Japan; [Kojima, Mikiko; Sakakibara, Hitoshi] RIKEN, Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Plant Prod Syst Res Grp, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Saito, Kazuki] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, Kazuko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Plant Mol Physiol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan",,"Maruyama, K (corresponding author), Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, Biol Resources & Postharvest Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,kyonosin@affrc.go.jp; akys@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Urano, Kaoru/A-9424-2018; Saito, Kazuki/D-2670-2009; Maruyama, Kyonoshin/I-9191-2012; Sakakibara, Hitoshi/A-6040-2010; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, Kazuko/K-9004-2015; Shinozaki, Kazuo/AAB-4945-2019; Kojima, Mikiko/D-1459-2017; Suzuki, Hideyuki/J-7571-2016; Shinozaki, Kazuo/G-4202-2013","Saito, Kazuki/0000-0001-6310-5342; Maruyama, Kyonoshin/0000-0001-7725-0380; Sakakibara, Hitoshi/0000-0001-5449-6492; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, Kazuko/0000-0002-0249-8258; Shinozaki, Kazuo/0000-0002-6317-9867; Shinozaki, Kazuo/0000-0002-6317-9867","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of JapanMinistry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan; Genomics for Agricultural Innovation, Development of Abiotic Stress Tolerant Crops by DREB Genes; Programme for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-Oriented Industry (BRAIN) of Japan; Japan Advanced Plant Science Network","This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (in part by Genomics for Agricultural Innovation, Development of Abiotic Stress Tolerant Crops by DREB Genes) and the Programme for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-Oriented Industry (BRAIN) of Japan.

An increase in ABA and ABA metabolite content was observed 48 h after wounding and remained elevated through 96 h. Wounding induced dramatic increases in the expression of the ABA metabolic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), and ABA-8'-hydroxylase. Although the patterns of wound-induced expression of individual genes varied, increased gene expression was observed within 3 h of wounding and remained elevated through 96 h. An apparent correlation between expression of the gene encoding ZEP and the increase in ABA content suggested that the wound-induced increase in ABA biosynthesis was regulated by both substrate availability and increased NCED activity. Suppression of wound-induced jasmonic acid accumulation by rinsing the wounded tissue with water did not inhibit the subsequent increase in ABA content. Exogenous ethylene completely suppressed the wound-induced increase in ABA content and dramatically reduced wound-induced up-regulation of ABA metabolic genes. This study is the first to identify the molecular bases for increased ABA accumulation following physical trauma in potato tubers and highlights the complex physiological interactions between various wound-induced hormones.

Russet Burbank). When functionally expressed in yeast, three potato CYP707A genes were demonstrated to encode enzymatically active ABA-8'-hydroxylases with micromolar affinities for (+)-ABA. The in vitro activity of the three enzymes was inhibited by the P450 azole-type inhibitors ancymidol, paclobutrazol, diniconazole, and tetcyclasis, and by the 8'-acetylene- and 8'-methylene-ABA analogues, with diniconazole and tetcyclasis being the most potent inhibitors. The in planta metabolism of [H-3]()-ABA to phaseic acid and dihydrophaseic acid in tuber meristems was inhibited by diniconazole, tetcyclasis, and to a lesser extent by 8'-acetylene- and 8'-methylene-ABA. Continuous exposure of in vitro generated microtubers to diniconazole resulted in a 2-fold increase in endogenous ABA content and a decline in dihydrophaseic acid content after 9 weeks of development. Similar treatment with 8'-acetylene-ABA had no effects on the endogenous contents of ABA or phaseic acid but reduced the content of dihydrophaseic acid. Tuber meristem dormancy progression was determined ex vitro in control, diniconazole-, and 8'-acetylene-ABA-treated microtubers following harvest. Continuous exposure to diniconazole during microtuber development had no effects on subsequent sprouting at any time point. Continuous exposure to 8'-acetylene-ABA significantly increased the rate of microtuber sprouting. The results indicate that, although a decrease in ABA content is a hallmark of tuber dormancy progression, the decline in ABA levels is not a prerequisite for dormancy exit and the onset of tuber sprouting.","[Suttle, Jeffrey C.; De Stefano-Beltran, Luis; Huckle, Linda L.] ARS, USDA, No Crop Sci Lab, Fargo, ND 58102 USA; [Abrams, Suzanne R.] Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Plant Biotechnol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W9, Canada",,"Suttle, JC (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, No Crop Sci Lab, 1605 Albrecht Blvd N, Fargo, ND 58102 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,jeff.suttle@ars.usda.gov,,,,,41,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0022-0957,1460-2431,SEP,2012,63,15,10.1093/jxb/ers146,Plant Sciences,011CD,WOS:000309140100028,22664582,"hybrid, Green Submitted",hybrid

A non-lethal freezing stress resulted in the retention of chlorophyll in seed at harvest that was most pronounced for seeds 28, 32 and 36 days after flowering (DAF). This increase was primarily due to an increased retention of chlorophyll a relative to chlorophyll b. Chlorophyll retention in seeds exposed to a non-lethal freezing stress correlated with an increased ABA catabolism, as measured 1, 3 or 7 days after the stress treatment. Although the non-lethal freezing stress had no significant effect on moisture content in seeds of siliques stressed at 28-44 DAF, moisture distribution, as viewed by magnetic resonance imaging, showed an uneven drying of 32 and 40 DAF siliques after exposure to the non-lethal freezing stress. Moisture was initially lost more rapidly from the silique wall between seeds, than in control non-stressed siliques. Increased moisture loss was not due to structural changes in the vasculature of the silique/seed of stressed tissues. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a non-lethal freezing stress-induced decrease in ABA level, during seed maturation, effects an inhibition of normal chlorophyll a catabolism resulting in mature but green B. napus seed.","Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Plant Biotechnol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W9, Canada",,"Bonham-Smith, PC (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.",Canada,North America,Global North,bonhamp@duke.usask.ca,,,,,48,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0032-0935,1432-2048,JUN,2006,224,1,10.1007/s00425-005-0203-y,Plant Sciences,046QM,WOS:000237826100014,16404579,Closed,Closed

The ABA 8'-hydroxylase is a key enzyme in ABA catabolism and is encoded by CYP707A genes. In this study, we examined physiological roles of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CYP707As in the plant's response to changes in humidity. The cyp707a1 and cyp707a3 mutants displayed lower stomatal conductance under turgid conditions (relative humidity 60%) than the wild type. When wild-type plants were transferred to high-humidity conditions (relative humidity 90%), CYP707A1 and CYP707A3 transcript levels increased, followed by the reduction of ABA levels. The cyp707a3 mutant exhibited high ABA levels even after transferring to high-humidity conditions, whereas, under similar conditions, the cyp707a1 mutant exhibited low ABA levels comparable to the wild type. Analysis of spatial expression patterns by using transgenic plants harboring a promoter:: beta-glucuronidase gene indicated that high-humidity-induced expression of CYP707A1 and CYP707A3 occurred primarily in guard cells and vascular tissues, respectively. Furthermore, stomatal closure of the cyp707a1 mutant, but not cyp707a3 mutant, was ABA hypersensitive when epidermal peel was treated with exogenous ABA, suggesting that CYP707A1 is essential for ABA catabolism inside the guard cells. These results implicate that CYP707A3 reduces the amount of mobile ABA in vascular tissues in response to high humidity, whereas CYP707A1 inactivates local ABA pools inside the guard cells. Taken together, ABA catabolism in both vascular tissues and guard cells participates in the systemic ABA action that controls stomatal movement in response to high humidity.","[Okamoto, Masanori; Tanaka, Yoko; Kamiya, Yuji; Seki, Motoaki; Nambara, Eiji] RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Nambara, Eiji] Univ Toronto, Dept Cell & Syst Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Nambara, Eiji] Univ Toronto, Ctr Anal Genome Evolut & Funct, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Abrams, Suzanne R.] Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Plant Biotechnol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W9, Canada",,"Nambara, E (corresponding author), RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,eiji.nambara@utoronto.ca,"Okamoto, Masanori/O-7096-2019; Nambara, Eiji/E-5533-2012; Kamiya, Yuji/F-9420-2010; Seki, Motoaki/I-2854-2012; Okamoto, Masanori/G-9503-2013","Okamoto, Masanori/0000-0002-1743-0408; Kamiya, Yuji/0000-0003-4415-520X; Seki, Motoaki/0000-0001-8288-0467; Okamoto, Masanori/0000-0002-1743-0408",RIKEN; NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This work was supported by the Special Postdoctoral Researcher's Program from RIKEN (to M.

Thus, spectroscopic data of isolated deuterated PA prepared from biotransformation of (+)-5,8',8',8'-d(4)-ABA in maize (Zea mays L. cv. Black Mexican Sweet) cell suspension cultures showed 83% deuterium incorporation at the 8'-exo position. Also, metabolism studies of (+)-4,5-d(2)-ABA in maize resulted in the isolation of deuterium labelled ABA derivatives, namely PA, dihydrophaseic acid (DPA), 4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosylDPA, 8'-hydroxyPA, 8'-hydroxyDPA and 8'oxoDPA, as deduced from spectroscopic methods. These combined results suggested the presence of an aldehyde intermediate which is either: (a) reduced to 8'-hydroxyABA and cyclized to PA, or (b) is hydrated and cyclized to 8'-hydroxyPA or (c) is further oxidized to the acid and cyclized to 8'-oxoPA.

Abscisic acid (ABA) and its metabolites, phaseic acid (PA), dihydrophaseic acid (DPA), 7'-hydroxy ABA (7'OH ABA) and ABA-glucose ester (ABA-GE), were quantified in western white pine seeds during dormancy breakage (moist chilling) and germination using an HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method with multiple reaction monitoring and internal standards incorporating deuterium-labeled analogs. In the seed coat, ABA and metabolite levels were high in dry seeds, but declined precipitously during the pre-moist-chilling water soak to relatively low levels thereafter. In the embryo and megagametophyte, ABA levels decreased significantly during moist chilling, coincident with an increase in the germination capacity of seeds. ABA catabolism occurred via several routes, depending on the stage and the seed tissue. Moist chilling of seeds led to increases in PA and DPA levels in both the embryo and megagametophyte. Within the embryo, 7'OH ABA and ABA-GE also accumulated during moist chilling; however, 7'OH ABA peaked early in germination. Changes in ABA flux, i.e. shifts in the ratio between biosynthesis and catabolism, occurred at three distinct stages during the transition from dormant seed to seedling. During moist chilling, the relative rate of ABA catabolism exceeded ABA biosynthesis. This trend became even more pronounced during germination, and germination was also accompanied by a decrease in the ABA catabolites DPA and PA, presumably as a result of their further metabolism and/or leaching/transport. The transition from germination to post-germinative growth was accompanied by a shift toward ABA biosynthesis. Dormant imbibed seeds, kept in warm moist conditions for 30 days (after an initial 13 days of soaking), maintained high ABA levels, while the amounts of PA, 7'OH ABA, and DPA decreased or remained at steady-state levels. Thus, in the absence of conditions required to break dormancy there were no net changes in ABA biosynthesis and catabolism.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Plant Biotechnol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W9, Canada",,"Kermode, AR (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",Canada,North America,Global North,kermode@sfu.ca,,"Feurtado, J Allan/0000-0001-8432-3066",,,48,79,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0032-0935,1432-2048,FEB,2004,218,4,10.1007/s00425-003-1139-8,Plant Sciences,773PW,WOS:000188933000015,14663585,Closed,Closed

We investigated the potential for S-abscisic acid (ABA) and an ABA analog [(+)-8'-acetylene ABA] to chemically thin apple fruit by causing a stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. Stomatal conductance (g(S)) of 'Imperial Gala'/M.7 was reduced by 60% 3 h after application of 250 mg.L-1 ABA or 25 mg.L-1 (+)-8'-acetylene ABA. Stomatal conductance began to recover 4 days after application but did not return to control levels until 19 days after treatment. Application of 250 mg.L-1 ABA combined with 100 mg.L-1 6-benzyladenine (6-BA) when mean fruit diameter approximate to 10 was mm reduced fruit set of 'Gala'/M.7 but not 'Pink Lady (TM)'/M.7 or 'Morganspur Delicious'/MM.111. Fruit set of 'Pink Lady (TM)'/M.7 was reduced by application of 20 mg.L-1(+)-8'-acetylene ABA + 100 mg.L-1 6-BA at full bloom or 10 mg.L-1 (+)-8'-acetylene ABA + 100 mg.L-1 6-BA at the 10-mm fruit diameter stage. Fruit set of 'Morganspur Delicious'/MM.111 was reduced by application of 25 mg.L-1 (+)-8'-acetylene ABA, either alone or in combination with 75 mg.L-1 6-BA, at the 10-mm fruit diameter stage. ABA and (+)-8'-acetylene ABA triggered leaf abscission at rates above 250 mg.L-1 and 25 mg.L-1, respectively. Fruit set and g(S) data from the present studies indicate the biological activity of (+)-8'-acetylene ABA is 10-fold higher than ABA. These results suggest that ABA and (+)-8'-acetylene ABA reduced fruit set by causing a stomatal limitation in photosynthesis that resulted in a transient carbohydrate stress. Thinning responses to ABA and (+)-8'-acetylene ABA at the concentrations used in these experiments were reduced compared with standard concentrations of currently available chemical thinning agents. However, increasing the concentration of ABA or (+)-8'-acetylene ABA to levels that would achieve comparable thinning are also likely to result in unacceptable leaf abscission.","[McArtney, Steven J.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Mt Hort Crops Res & Extens Ctr, Mills River, NC 28759 USA; [Abrams, Suzanne R.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Chem, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C7, Canada; [Woolard, Derek D.; Petracek, Peter D.] Valent BioSci Corp, Long Grove, IL 60047 USA",,"McArtney, SJ (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Mt Hort Crops Res & Extens Ctr, 455 Res Dr, Mills River, NC 28759 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,steve_mcartney@ncsu.edu,,,,,,15,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,JUN,2014,49,6,10.21273/HORTSCI.49.6.763,Horticulture,,Agriculture,,gold,

The predominant pathway of ABA catabolism was via 8'-hydroxylase to form phaseic acid, while conjugation to glucose was minor. In response to water deficit imposed on whole plants during kernel development, ABA accumulated to higher concentrations in apical than basal kernels, while both returned to control levels after rewatering. ABA catabolism activity per gram fresh weight increased about three-fold in response to water stress, but was about the same in apical and basal kernels on a fresh weight basis. ABA catabolism activity was three to four-fold higher in placenta than endosperm, and activity was higher in apical than basal kernels. In vitro incubation tests indicated that glucose did not affect ABA catabolism. We conclude that placenta tissue plays an important role in ABA catabolism, and together with ABA influx and compartmentation, determine the rate of ABA transport into endosperms.

Transgenic plants constitutively overexpressing UGT71B6 (71B6-OE) have been analysed for changes in ABA and the related ABA metabolites abscisic acid glucose ester (ABA-GE), phaseic acid (PA), dihydrophaseic acid (DPA), 7 '-hydroxyABA and neo-phaseic acid. Overexpression of the GT led to massive accumulation of ABA-GE and reduced levels of the oxidative metabolites PA and DPA, but had marginal effect on levels of free ABA. The control of ABA homeostasis, as reflected in levels of the different metabolites, differed in the 71B6-OEs whether the plants were grown under standard conditions or subjected to wilt stress. The impact of increased glucosylation of ABA on ABA-related phenotypes has also been assessed. Increased glucosylation of ABA led to phenotypic changes in post-germinative growth. The use of two structural analogues of ABA, known to have biological activity but to differ in their capacity to act as substrates for 71B6 in vitro, confirmed that the phenotypic changes arose specifically from the increased glucosylation caused by overexpression of 71B6. The phenotype and profile of ABA and related metabolites in a knockout line of 71B6, relative to wild type, has been assessed during Arabidopsis development and following stress treatments. The lack of major changes in these parameters is discussed in the context of functional redundancy of the multigene family of GTs in Arabidopsis.","Univ York, Dept Biol, CNAP, Area 8, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Plant Biotechnol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W9, Canada",,"Bowles, DJ (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Biol, CNAP, Area 8, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",England,Europe,Global North,djb32@york.ac.uk,,"Higgins, Gillian/0000-0003-2963-1597; Vaistij, Fabian/0000-0002-1469-0589",,,59,152,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-7412,1365-313X,MAY,2006,46,3,10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02701.x,Plant Sciences,030ZK,WOS:000236673700011,16623908,Bronze,Bronze

CDN is the precursor of desoxyhemigossypol and hemigossypol defense sesquiterpenes. In this paper we have studied the mechanism for the cyclization of FDP and the putative intermediate, nerolidyl diphosphate, to CDN. A purified recombinant CDN synthase (CDN1-C1) expressed in Escherichia coli from CDN1-C1 cDNA isolated from Gossypium arboreum cyclizes (1RS)-[1-H-2](E, E)-FDP to > 98% [5-H-2]and [11-H-2]CDN. Enzyme reaction mixtures cyclize (3RS)-[4,4,13,13,13-H-2(5)]-nerolidyl diphosphate to 62.1% [8,8,15,15,15-H-2(5)]-CDN, 15.8% [6,6,15,15,15-H-2(5)]-alpha -bisabolol, 8.1% [6,6,15,15,15-H-2(5)]-(beta)-bisabolene, 9.8% [4,4,13,13-H-2(4)]-(E)-beta -farnesene, and 4.2% unknowns. Competitive studies show that (SR)-nerolidyl diphosphate is the active enantiomer of (3RS)-nerolidyl diphosphate that cyclized to CDN. The k(cat)/K-m values demonstrate that the synthase uses (E,E)-FDP as effectively as (3R)-nerolidyl diphosphate in the formation of CDN. Cyclization studies with (3R)-nerolidyl diphosphate show that the formation of CDN, (E)-beta -farnesene, and beta -bisabolene are enzyme dependent, but the formation of alpha -bisabolol in the reaction mixtures was a Mg2+-dependent solvolysis of nerolidyl diphosphate. Enzyme mechanisms are proposed for the formation of CDN from (E,E)-FDP and for the formation of CDN, (E)-beta -farnesene, and beta -bisabolene from (3RS)-nerolidyl diphosphate. The primary structures of cotton CDN synthase and tobacco epi-aristolochene synthase show 48% identity, suggesting similar three-dimensional structures. We used the SWISS-MODEL to test this. The two enzymes have the same overall structure consisting of two cu-helical domains and epi-aristolochene synthase is a good model for the structure of CDN synthase. Several amino acids in the primary structures of both synthases superimpose. The amino acids having catalytic roles in epi-aristochene synthase are substituted in the CDN synthase and may be related to differences in catalytic properties.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; USDA ARS, So Plains Agr Res Ctr, College Stn, TX 77845 USA",,"Benedict, CR (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,,,,,,22,49,AMER SOC PLANT PHYSIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,APR,2001,125,4,10.1104/pp.125.4.1754,Plant Sciences,424CU,WOS:000168215200024,11299356,"Green Published, Bronze",

However, to date little is known about the biosynthesis of volatile terpenes in this crop. Herein is reported that 5 monoterpenes and 11 sesquiterpenes from extracts of a glanded cotton cultivar, Gossypium hirsutum cv. CCRI12, were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). By EST data mining combined with Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE), full-length cDNAs of three terpene synthases (TPSs), GhTPS1, GhTPS2 and GhTPS3 were isolated. By in vitro assays of the recombinant proteins, it was found that GhTPS1 and GhTPS2 are sesquiterpene synthases: the former converted farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) into beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene in a ratio of 2:1, whereas the latter produced several sesquiterpenes with guaia-1(10),11-diene as the major product. By contrast, GhTPS3 is a monoterpene synthase, which produced alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, beta-phellandrene and trace amounts of other monoterpenes from geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). The TPS activities were also supported by Virus Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) in the cotton plant. GhTPS1 and GhTPS3 were highly expressed in the cotton plant overall, whereas GhTPS2 was expressed only in leaves. When stimulated by mechanical wounding, Verticillium dahliae (Vde) elicitor or methyl jasmonate (MeJA), production of terpenes and expression of the corresponding synthase genes were induced.

Bay leaves, with their abundant monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, are used to impart flavor and aroma to food, and have also drawn attention in recent years because of their potential pharmaceutical applications. To identify terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these volatile terpenes, we performed RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptome of L. nobilis leaves. Bioinformatic analysis led to the identification of eight TPS complementary DNAs. We characterized the enzymes encoded by three of these complementary DNAs: a monoterpene synthase that belongs to the TPS-b clade catalyzes the formation of mostly 1,8-cineole; a sesquiterpene synthase belonging to the TPS-a clade catalyzes the formation of mainly cadinenes; and a diterpene synthase of the TPS-e/f clade catalyzes the formation of geranyllinalool. Comparison of the sequences of these three TPSs indicated that the TPS-a and TPS-b clades of the TPS gene family evolved early in the evolution of the angiosperm lineage, and that geranyllinalool synthase activity is the likely ancestral function in angiosperms of genes belonging to an ancient TPS-e/f subclade that diverged from the kaurene synthase gene lineages before the split of angiosperms and gymnosperms.","[Yahyaa, Mosaab; Doron-Faigenboim, Adi; Bar, Einat; Davidovich-Rikanati, Rachel; Lewinsohn, Efraim; Ibdah, Mwafaq] Agr Res Org, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Matsuba, Yuki; McClain, Alan; Pichersky, Eran] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Brandt, Wolfgang] Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Dept Bioorgan Chem, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",,"Ibdah, M (corresponding author), Agr Res Org, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel.",Israel,Middle east,Global North,mwafaq@volcani.agri.gov.il,,,National Science Foundation of the United StatesNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1025636],This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of the United States (grant no.

Maize produces a variety of terpenoids involved in defense response. Despite some terpene synthases (TPSs) responsible for these terpenoids have been characterized, biosynthesis of many terpenes, particularly sesquiterpenes, which were produced in response to biotic or abiotic stress, remains largely unknown. Here, we characterized ZmTPS7 biochemically through recombinant expression in Escherichia coli and detected that it catalyzed formation of a blend of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoid alcohols as the sesquiterpene synthase through GC-MS analysis. Subsequently, the major product was purified and identified as tau-cadinol through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) analysis, which was also detected in maize tissues infected by pathogen fungus for the first time. ZmTPS7 constitutively expressed in aerial tissues while with trace amount of transcript in roots. Fungus spore inoculation and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment induced gene expression of ZmTPS7 in leaves, while exogenous ABA induced ZmTPS7 dramatically in roots, suggesting that ZmTPS7 might be involved in stress response. tau-cadinol was quantified in infected maize tissues with the concentration of similar to 200 ng/g fresh weight, however, which was much lower than the inhibitory one on two tested necrotrophic fungi. Such evidences indicate that anti-fungal activity of tau-cadinol is not physiologically relevant, and further investigation is needed to clarify its biological functions in maize. Taken together, ZmTPS7 was characterized as the tau-cadinol synthase and suggested to be involved in stress response, which also increased the diversity of maize terpenoid profile.","[Ren, Fei; Mao, Hongjie; Liang, Jin; Liu, Jiang; Shu, Kai; Wang, Qiang] Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol Agr, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",,"Wang, Q (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol Agr, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,qwang@sicau.edu.cn,"Shu, Kai/AAN-6517-2020","Shu, Kai/0000-0003-4888-3001; Liang, Jin/0000-0002-8862-7021",fund for distinguished young scientists of Sichuan Province [2014JQ0038]; Sichuan Agricultural University,This work was supported by the fund for distinguished young scientists of Sichuan Province (2014JQ0038) and start-up fund from Sichuan Agricultural University to Q.W.

Usnic acid is uniquely found in lichens, and is especially abundant in genera such as Alectoria, Cladonia, Usnea, Lecanora, Ramalina and Evernia. Many lichens and extracts containing usnic acid have been utilized for medicinal, perfumery, cosmetic as well as ecological applications. Usnic acid as a pure substance has been formulated in creams, toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorants and sunscreen products, in some cases as an active principle, in others as a preservative. In addition to antimicrobial activity against human and plant pathogens, usnic acid has been shown to exhibit antiviral, antiprotozoal, antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. Ecological effects, such as antigrowth, antiherbivore and anti-insect properties, have also been demonstrated. A difference in biological activity has in some cases been observed between the two enantiomeric forms of usnic acid. Recently health food supplements containing usnic acid have been promoted for use in weight reduction, with little scientific support. The emphasis of the current review is on the chemistry and biological activity of usnic acid and its derivatives in addition to rational and ecologically acceptable methods for provision of this natural compound on a large scale.

Although the genes associated with beta -glucan synthesis have been identified, genetic regulation of beta -glucan accumulation in barley grains is still completely unclear. In this study, 100 accessions from International Barley Core Selected Collection (BCS) were planted in two environments for two consecutive years to determine the genotypic variation of grain beta -glucan content. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 14 stable marker-trait associations (MTAs) (-Log10(P)>4) for grain beta -glucan content. Significantly positive correlation was found between grain beta -glucan content and the number of favorable alleles of 14 stable MTAs. Seven putative candidate genes encoding some enzymes in glucose metabolism were found to be associated with beta -glucan content. One of the putative genes, HORVU6Hr1G088380, could be an important gene controlling barely beta -glucan content, with the SNPs being closely linked in all tested accessions and divided into two haplotypes. High resolution melting (HRM) analysis of the first SNP suggested that the HRM-SNP marker is valid for marker-assisted selection in barley breeding.

Many light-triggered processes are thought to contribute to this reduction, namely photorespiration, corticular photosynthesis or even an inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. In this study, we investigated these processes with the objective to discriminate their influence to the overall reduction of branch CO2 release in the light. CO2 gas-exchange measurements of young birch (Betula pendula Roth.) branches (< 1.5 cm) performed under photorespiratory (20% O-2) and non-photorespiratory (< 2%) conditions revealed that photorespiration does not play a pre-dominant role in carbon exchange. This suppression of photorespiration was attributed to the high CO2 concentrations (C-i) within the bark tissues (1544 +/- 227 and 618 +/- 43 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) in the dark and in the light, respectively). Changes in xylem CO2 were not likely to explain the observed decrease in stem CO2 release as gas-exchange measurements before and after cutting of the branches did not effect CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Combined fluorescence and gas-exchange measurements provided evidence that the light-dependent reduction in CO2 release can pre-dominantly be attributed to corticular refixation, whereas an inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in the light is unlikely to occur. Corticular photosynthesis was able to refix up to 97% of the CO2 produced by branch respiration, although it rarely led to a positive net photosynthetic rate.","Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Appl Bot, D-45117 Essen, Germany; CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale & Forestale, I-00185 Rome, Italy; CNR, Atmospher Pollut Inst, I-00016 Monterotondo, Italy",,"Pfanz, H (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Appl Bot, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,hardy.pfanz@uni-essen.de,"Loreto, Francesco/B-7477-2015; Pietrini, Fabrizio/AAY-5864-2020","Loreto, Francesco/0000-0002-9171-2681;",,,62,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,JUN,2006,29,6,10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01495.x,Plant Sciences,042GC,WOS:000237514900011,17080940,Closed,Closed

The method enables determination of the rates of CO2 fixation, photorespiration and respiration in the light under steady-state photosynthesis and discrimination between primary and stored photosynthates as substrates of photorespiratory and respiratory decarboxylations. The method is based on the analysis of the time curves of (CO2)-C-14 evolution from labeled primary and stored photosynthates in leaves previously exposed to (CO2)-C-14. The molar rates of different decarboxylation reactions are calculated from the initial slopes of the curves taking into account the specific radioactivity of CO2 fed to leaves and/or evolved from leaves. To estimate the contribution of primary and stored photosynthates, the measurements of (CO2)-C-14 evolution are performed after feeding plant leaves for different periods with (CO2)-C-14. Photorespiration and respiration are distinguished on the basis of data obtained from measurements of (CO2)-C-14 evolution under normal (210 ml l(-1)) and low (15 ml l(-1)) concentrations of oxygen. A principally new method for the determination of the rate of intracellular refixation of respiratory CO2 has been developed. The method is based on the measurements of (CO2)-C-14 evolution from leaves into the medium of very high concentrations (30 ml l 21) of (CO2)-C-12, where the probability of refixation of (CO2)-C-14 evolved inside the cell is close to zero. The results obtained were comparable with the data derived from parallel refixation measurements by means of gasometric methods.

Neither male- and female-sterility mutations (ms1-1 and bell1, respectively) nor surgical removal of the stems with inflorescences (bolts) at various stages significantly increased the longevity of individual rosette leaves, yet the mutants and treated plants lived 20-50 d longer, measured by the death of the last rosette and/or the last cauline leaf. A series of growth mutations (clv2-4, clv3-2, det3, vam1 enh, and dark green) also increased plant longevity by 20-30 d but did not delay the overall development of the plants. The mutations prolonged plant life through the production of new leaves and stems with inflorescences (bolts) rather than by extending leaf longevity. In growing stems, the newly-formed leaves may induce senescence in the older leaves; however, removal of the younger leaves did not significantly increase the life of the older leaves on the compressed stems of Arabidopsis. Since plants that produce more bolts also live longer, the reproductive load (dry weight) of the bolts did not seem to drive leaf or whole plant senescence here. The developing reproductive structures caused the death of the plant by preventing regeneration of leaves and bolts, which are green and presumably photosynthetic. They also exerted a correlative control (repression) on the development of additional reproductive structures.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Nooden, LD (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Nat Sci Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,,,,,,21,104,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0022-0957,,NOV,2001,52,364,10.1093/jexbot/52.364.2151,Plant Sciences,486YR,WOS:000171847400010,11604454,Closed,Closed

In Germany, geographically distant oak stands show differences in infestation strength by the forest cockchafer. While in Southwestern Germany this insect causes severe damage, oak forests in northern Germany are rarely infested. It is known that root-released volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are perceived by soil herbivores, thus guiding the larvae toward the host roots. In this work, we exposed seedlings of two distant oak provenances to forest cockchafer larvae and studied their population genetic properties, their root-based VOC chemotypes, their attraction for larvae and terpene synthase gene expression. Based on nuclear and chloroplast marker analysis, we found both oak populations to be genetically highly variable while showing typical patterns of migration from different refugial regions. However, no clear association between genetic constitution of the different provenances and the abundance of cockchafer populations on site was observed. In contrast to observations in the field, bioassays revealed a preference of the larvae for the northeastern oak provenance. The behavior of larvae was most likely related to root-released volatile terpenes and benzenoids since their composition and quantity differed between oak populations. We assume repellent effects of these compounds because the populations attractive to insects showed low abundance of these compounds. Five different oak terpene synthase (TPS) genes were identified at the genomic level which can be responsible for biosynthesis of the released terpenes. TPS gene expression patterns in response to larval feeding revealed geographic variation rather than genotypic variation. Our results support the assumption that root-released VOC are influencing the perception of roots by herbivores.","[Creyaufmueller, Friederike Carolin; Kreuzwieser, Jurgen] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Chair Tree Physiol, Freiburg, Germany; [Chassignet, Isabelle; Delb, Horst; Dounavi, Aikaterini; Teply-Szymanski, Julia] Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Dept Forest Protect, Freiburg, Germany; [Gailing, Oliver; Leinemann, Ludger; Vornam, Barbara] Univ Gottingen, Dept Forest Genet & Forest Tree Breeding, Gottingen, Germany",,"Teply-Szymanski, J (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Dept Forest Protect, Freiburg, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,teply.szymanski@gmail.com,"Gailing, Oliver/X-2690-2019","Gailing, Oliver/0000-0002-4572-2408; Dounavi, Aikaterini/0000-0002-4738-6698","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Freiburg; Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung (BLE), Germany [28WC4031]; Bundesministerium fur Ernahrung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL); Bundesministerium fur Umwelt, Naturschutz, Bau und Reaktorsicherheit (BMUB) based on the decision of the German Federal Parliament","The article processing charge was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the University of Freiburg in the funding program Open Access Publishing.

Two sister oak species, Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata. occur in sympatry in Florida and throughout the southeastern United States. In 11 sites from northern and southeastern regions of Florida, we used a leaf-based morphological index to identify individuals to species. Eleven nuclear microsatellite markers significantly differentiated between the species with a high correspondence between molecular and morphological typing of specimens. Nevertheless, Bayesian clustering analysis indicates interspecific gene flow, and six of 109 individuals had mixed ancestry. The identity of several individuals also was mismatched using molecular markers and morphological characters. In a common environment, the two species performed differently in terms of photosynthetic performance and growth, corresponding to their divergent ecological niches with respect to soil moisture and other edaphic properties. Our data support earlier hypotheses that divergence in flowering time causes assortative mating, allowing these ecologically distinct sister species to occur in sympatry. Limited gene flow that permits ecological differentiation helps to explain the overdispersion of oak species in local communities.","[Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Pahlich, Annette] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",,"Cavender-Bares, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,cavender@umn.edu,"Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013","Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630","Graduate School Dean's office, University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System","The authors thank K.

To understand historical and future evolutionary and ecological responses to climate, we compared the association of geography and climate of three oak species (Quercus engelmannii, Quercus berberidifolia, and Quercus cornelius-mulleri) in an environmentally heterogeneous region of southern California at three organizational levels: regional species distributions, genetic variation, and phenotypic variation. METHODS: We identified climatic variables influencing regional distribution patterns using species distribution models (SDMs), and then tested whether those individual variables are important in shaping genetic (microsatellite) and phenotypic (leaf morphology) variation. We estimated the relative contributions of geography and climate using multivariate redundancy analyses (RDA) with variance partitioning. KEY RESULTS: The modeled distribution of each species was influenced by climate differently. Our analysis of genetic variation using RDA identified small but significant associations between genetic variation with climate and geography in Q. engelmannii and Q. cornelius-mulleri, but not in Q. berberidifolia, and climate explained more of the variation. Our analysis of phenotypic variation in Q. engelmannii indicated that climate had more impact than geography, but not in Q. berberidifolia. Throughout our analyses, we did not find a consistent pattern in effects of individual climatic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative analysis illustrates that climate influences tree response at all organizational levels, but the important climate factors vary depending on the level and on the species. Because of these species-specific and level-specific responses, today's sympatric species are unlikely to have similar distributions in the future.","[Riordan, Erin C.; Gugger, Paul F.; Smith, Carrie; Gaddis, Keith; Thompson, Pam; Sork, Victoria L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Box 957239, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ortego, Joaquin] CSIC, Dept Integrat Ecol, EBD, Seville 41092, Spain; [Sork, Victoria L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Sork, VL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Box 957239, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Sork, VL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,vlsork@ucla.edu,"Gugger, Paul F/A-4005-2010; Ortego, Joaquin/F-4936-2010","Gugger, Paul F/0000-0002-4464-8453; Ortego, Joaquin/0000-0003-2709-429X",UCLA; Jose Castillejo research fellowship; Severo Ochoa (EBD) research fellowship [SEV-2012-0262],"The authors thank the members of the Sork laboratory who have helped with field sampling over the years.

Since the plant meristem consists of many cells, as well as obtaining tetraploids, it is possible to obtain mixoploids (chimeras consisting of diploid and tetraploid tissue) after colchicine treatment. Flow cytometry was used to determine the DNA ploidy level of different tissues of individual hop plants following colchicine treatment of diploid hops. Plants that are shown to be mixoploid after analysis of leaf tissue can display higher levels of tetraploid nuclei in root tissue, such that they could be mistakenly classified as tetraploid. The hop variety Galena-4n, which was previously considered to be a tetraploid, is shown to be a mixoploid based on leaf material. However, Galena-4n consistently produces triploid progeny when crossed with a diploid hop variety, indicating that Galena-4n produces tetraploid reproductive tissues and is effectively a tetraploid from a breeding perspective. The results from this study indicate that care should be taken when determining the DNA ploidy level of an individual plant after exposure to genome-doubling agents based on single tissues and that leaf tissue is a choice material for flow cytometric analysis. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have shown that ppGpp synthase and hydrolase are also conserved in eukaryotes, although their functions are not well understood. We recently showed that ppGpp-overaccumulation in Arabidopsis chloroplasts results in robust growth under nutrient-limited conditions, demonstrating that the bacterial-like stringent response at least functions in plastids. To test if ppGpp also functions in the cytosol, we constructed the transgenic Arabidopsis expressing Bacillus subtilis ppGpp synthase gene yjbM. Upon induction of the gene, the mutant synthesizes approximate to 10-20-fold higher levels of ppGpp, and its fresh weight was reduced to 80% that of the wild type.

Dorfman's group testing method is effective for reducing the number of laboratory analyses, but does not consider the case where AP is diluted below the sensitivity of the analyses, which causes the rate of false negatives to increase. The objective of this study is to propose binomial and negative binomial probabilistic models for determining the required sample size (n), number of pools (g), and size of the pool (k) for detecting individuals possessing AP with a probability >=(1 - alpha) (for a small a) given: (1) pool size (k); (2) estimated proportion of individuals with AP in the population (p); (3) concentration of the trait of interest (AP) in individual seeds (w); and (4) detection limit of the test (c) (AP concentration in a pool below which it cannot be detected), The proposed models consider the different rates of false positives (5) and false negatives (A), and the assessment of consumer and producer risks. Results have shown that when using the negative binomial, a required sample size n can be determined that guarantees a high probability that m individuals or g pools containing AP will be found. The pools formed have an optimum size, such that one element with AP will be detected at a low cost. The negative binomial distribution should be used when it is known that the proportion of individuals with AP in the population is p < 0.1; thus, it is guaranteed that m individuals or g pools of individuals with AP will be detected with high probability.","[Crossa, Jose] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, CRIL, Biometr & Stat Unit, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Hernandez-Suarez, Carlos M.] Univ Colima, Fac Ciencias, Colima, Colima, Mexico; [Montesinos-Lopez, Osval A.] Univ Colima, Fac Telemat, Colima, Colima, Mexico; [McLaren, Graham] IRRI, CRIL, Biometr & Bioinformat Unit, Manila, Philippines",,"Crossa, J (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, CRIL, Biometr & Stat Unit, Apdo Postal 6-641, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",Mexico,North America,Global South,j.crossa@cgiar.org,"Crossa, Jose/AAE-7898-2019; Hernandez-Suarez, Carlos/AAD-9414-2021","Hernandez-Suarez, Carlos/0000-0003-2216-0905; Crossa, Jose/0000-0001-9429-5855; Montesinos-Lopez, Osval Antonio/0000-0002-3973-6547",,,,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0960-2585,,JUN,2008,18,2,10.1017/S0960258508975565,Plant Sciences,,Plant Sciences,,,

Formation of NO during symbiotic interactions has been reported, but the role and sources of NO in nodules remain unclear. In this work, the involvement of denitrification, performed by the symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum, in NO formation in soybean nodules in response to flooding conditions has been investigated by inoculating plants with napA-, nirK-, or norC-deficient mutants. Levels of nitrosylleghemoglobin (LbNO) in flooded nirK and norC nodules were significantly higher than those observed in wild-type nodules. In addition, nirK and norC nodules accumulated more nitrite and NO, respectively, than wild-type nodules. By contrast, levels of LbNO, nitrite, and NO in flooded napA nodules were lower than in wild-type nodules. These results suggest that LbNO formation in soybean nodules in response to flooding conditions is caused by nitrite and NO generated from periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap) and also containing nitrite reductase (NirK) denitrification enzymes. Flooding caused a decrease of nifH expression and nitrogenase activity in wild-type and norC nodules but not in napA or nirK nodules. Incubation of wild-type and norC nodules with a NO scavenger counteracted the effect of flooding. Under free-living conditions, B-galactosidase activity from a nifD'-'lacZ fusion decreased in a norC mutant, which also accumulated NO in the medium. These results suggest that NO formed by Cu-containing nitrite reductase in soybean nodules in response to flooding has a negative effect on expression of nitrogenase. We propose that Lb has a major role in detoxifying NO and nitrite produced by bacteroidal denitrification in response to flooding conditions.","[Sanchez, Cristina; Bedmar, Eulogio J.; Delgado, Maria J.] CSIC, Estac Expt Zaidin, E-18080 Granada, Spain; [Gates, Andrew J.; Meakin, Georgina E.; Richardson, David J.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Uchiumi, Toshiki] Kagoshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Girard, Lourdes] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Genom, Programa Genom Func Procariotes, Cuernavaca 62271, Morelos, Mexico",,"Delgado, MJ (corresponding author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zaidin, POB 419, E-18080 Granada, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,mdelgado@eez.csic.es,"Sanchez, Cristina/B-4737-2019; Gates, Andrew J/F-8218-2011; Richardson, David J/E-2275-2011; Delgado, Maria J/F-2683-2017; Meakin, Georgina/AAE-6675-2021","Sanchez, Cristina/0000-0001-9580-9635; Gates, Andrew J/0000-0002-4594-5038; Delgado, Maria J/0000-0003-2410-9484; Meakin, Georgina/0000-0002-9223-3017",Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [AGL2006-13848-CO2-02/AGR]; Ciencia y Tecnologia para el Desarrollo [107PICO312]; Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [BIO-275]; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) [2007GB0035]; CSIC/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [2005MX0032]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission,"This work was supported by grant AGL2006-13848-CO2-02/AGR from the Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia, and 107PICO312 from Ciencia y Tecnologia para el Desarrollo.

One of such functions is the onset of a proper symbiosis with Mesorhizobium loti resulting in the formation of actively N-2-fixing nodules. Stable overexpression lines (Ox1 and Ox2) of LjGlb1-1 were generated and phenotyped. Both Ox lines showed reduced NO levels in roots and enhanced nitrogenase activity in mature and senescent nodules relative to the wild-type (WT). Physiological and cytological observations indicated that overexpression of LjGlb1-1 delayed nodule senescence. The application to WT nodules of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) or the phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) repressed nitrogenase activity, induced the expression of three senescence-associated genes and caused cytological changes evidencing nodule senescence. These effects were almost completely reverted by the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide. Our results reveal that overexpression of LjGlb1-1 improves the activity of mature nodules and delays nodule senescence in the L.japonicus-M.loti symbiosis. These beneficial effects are probably mediated by the participation of LjGlb1-1 in controlling the concentration of NO that may be produced downstream in the phytohormone signaling pathway in nodules.","[Fukudome, Mitsutaka; Watanabe, Eri; Osuki, Ken-Ichi; Uchiumi, Toshiki] Kagoshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, 1-21-35 Korimoto, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Imaizumi, Ryujiro; Aoki, Toshio] Nihon Univ, Dept Appl Biol Sci, 1866 Kameino, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 2520880, Japan; [Becana, Manuel] CSIC, Dept Nutr Vegetal, Estn Expt Aula Dei, Apartado 13034, E-50080 Zaragoza, Spain",,"Uchiumi, T (corresponding author), Kagoshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, 1-21-35 Korimoto, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,uttan@sci.kagoshima-u.ac.jp,"Becana, Manuel/L-5454-2014","Becana, Manuel/0000-0002-1083-0804; Fukudome, Mitsutaka/0000-0002-8325-3614","Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Bilateral Joint Research Projects (Japan); National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB) Collaborative Research Program [Japan] [16-305, 17-309]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [Spain] [AGL2017-85775-R]; JSPS KAKENHI [Japan]Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP18J11872]","Open Partnership Joint Projects of the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Bilateral Joint Research Projects (Japan) and National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB) Collaborative Research Program [16-305 and 17-309, Japan to T.U.]; the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2017-85775-R, Spain to M.B.]; and JSPS KAKENHI Research Fellows [JP18J11872, Japan to M.F.].",54,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,1471-9053,APR,2019,60,4,10.1093/pcp/pcy245,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,HW7IL,WOS:000466863300010,30597068,Green Submitted,

Here, we report the genetic diversities of 44 important genes related to grain yield, quality, adaptation and resistance in 121 Ningxia and 86 introduced wheat cultivars and advanced lines. Results: The population structure indicated characteristics of genetic components of Ningxia wheat, including landraces of particular genetic resources, introduced varieties with rich genetic diversities and modern cultivars in different periods. Analysis of allele frequencies showed that the dwarfing alleles Rht-B1b at Rht-B1 and Rht-D1b at Rht-D1, 1BL/1RS translocation, Hap-1 at GW2-6B and Hap-H at Sus2-2B are very frequently present in modern Ningxia cultivars and in introduced varieties from other regions but absent in landraces. This indicates that the introduced wheat germplasm with numerous beneficial genes is vital for broadening the genetic diversity of Ningxia wheat varieties. Large population differentiation between modern cultivars and landraces has occurred in adaptation genes. Founder parents carry excellent allele combinations of important genes, with a higher number of favorable alleles than modern cultivars. Gene flow analysis showed that six founder parents have greatly contributed to breeding improvement in Ningxia Province, particularly Zhou 8425B, for yield-related genes. Conclusions: Varieties introduced from other regions with rich genetic diversity and landraces with well-adapted genetic resources have been applied to improve modern cultivars. Founder parents, particularly Zhou 8425B, for yield-related genes have contributed greatly to wheat breeding improvement in Ningxia Province. These findings will greatly benefit bread wheat breeding in Ningxia Province as well as other areas with similar ecological environments.","[Zhang, Weijun; He, Jinshang; Kang, Ling; Wang, Xiaoliang; Zhang, Fuguo; Chen, Dongsheng] Ningxia Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Crop Res Inst, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Junjie; Ma, Xiongfeng] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Cotton Res, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Anyang 455000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Hao, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs,Inst Crop Sci, Key Lab Crop Gene Resources & Germplasm Enhanceme, Natl Key Facil Crop Gene Resources & Genet Improv, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Chen, DS (corresponding author), Ningxia Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Crop Res Inst, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China.; Ma, XF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Cotton Res, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Anyang 455000, Henan, Peoples R China.; Hao, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs,Inst Crop Sci, Key Lab Crop Gene Resources & Germplasm Enhanceme, Natl Key Facil Crop Gene Resources & Genet Improv, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,haochenyang@caas.cn; maxiongfeng@caas.cn; cdsnky@163.com,,,Introduction of KASP technology and its application in identification and evaluation of wheat germplasm resources in Ningxia [DWHZC-2017006]; Ningxia Agricultural Breeding Project [2018NYYZ02]; Ningxia Province central guidance local science and technology development project [2020YDDF0056],"This work was supported by Introduction of KASP technology and its application in identification and evaluation of wheat germplasm resources in Ningxia (DWHZC-2017006), Ningxia Agricultural Breeding Project (2018NYYZ02) and Ningxia Province central guidance local science and technology development project (2020YDDF0056).",83,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2229,,18-Feb,2021,21,1,10.1186/s12870-021-02870-5,Plant Sciences,QL3BQ,WOS:000620955700005,33602134,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",Gold

In this paper, lyso-phosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), which can esterify acyl-CoA into the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone during the triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, has been isolated from coconut endosperm, designated CnLPAAT. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the CnLPAAT transcript was present in both leaves and endosperms, with the higher level in mature leaves, and the transcript level was constant during coconut endosperm development. Heterologous expression in yeast was used to confirm the in vivo function of CnLPAAT. The fatty acid analysis showed that the levels of C12:0 and C14:0 in a CnLPAAT-pYES2 transformant increased significantly compared with a pYES2 transformant Additionally, to detect the effect of CnLPAAT expression in plants, it was heterologously overexpressed in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L) under the control of the seed-specific napin promoter. The transcript level of CnLPAAT varied 28-fold among different transgenic lines, with 11 lines displaying detectable levels of CnLPAAT expression. However, an analysis of the fatty acid composition of transgenic tobacco seeds showed that the levels of C12:0 and C14:0 decreased diversely in comparison with untransformed tobacco plants. These findings provide new insights into the activities of CnLPAAT and assist in genetically applying this functional mechanism in other plants to accumulate high levels of MCFAs.

In the case of TAGs, this reaction is typically catalyzed by an LPAT2 from microsomal LPAT class A that has high specificity for C18 fatty acids containing Delta 9 unsaturation. Because of this specificity, the occurrence of saturated fatty acids in the TAG sn-2 position is infrequent in seed oils. To identify LPATs with variant substrate specificities, deep transcriptomic mining was performed on seeds of two Cuphea species producing TAGs that are highly enriched in saturated C8 and C10 fatty acids. From these analyses, cDNAs for seven previously unreported LPATs were identified, including cDNAs from Cuphea viscosissima (CvLPAT2) and Cuphea avigera var. pulcherrima (CpuLPAT2a) encoding microsomal, seed-specific class A LPAT2s and a cDNA from C. avigera var. pulcherrima (CpuLPATB) encoding a microsomal, seed-specific LPAT from the bacterial-type class B. The activities of these enzymes were characterized in Camelina sativa by seed-specific co-expression with cDNAs for various Cuphea FatB acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases (FatB) that produce a variety of saturated medium-chain fatty acids. CvLPAT2 and CpuLPAT2a expression resulted in accumulation of 10: 0 fatty acids in the Camelina sativa TAG sn-2 position, indicating a 10: 0 CoA specificity that has not been previously described for plant LPATs. CpuLPATB expression generated TAGs with 14: 0 at the sn-2 position, but not 10:0. Identification of these LPATs provides tools for understanding the structural basis of LPAT substrate specificity and for generating altered oil functionalities.","[Kim, Hae Jin; Silva, Jillian E.; Iskandarov, Umidjon; Cahoon, Rebecca E.; Cahoon, Edgar B.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biochem, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Kim, Hae Jin; Silva, Jillian E.; Iskandarov, Umidjon; Cahoon, Rebecca E.; Cahoon, Edgar B.] Univ Nebraska, Ctr Plant Sci Innovat, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Andersson, Mariette] Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Breeding Swedish, Alnarp, Sweden; [Mockaitis, Keithanne] Indiana Univ, Pervas Technol Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Mockaitis, Keithanne] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"Cahoon, EB (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Biochem, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,ecahoon2@unl.edu,,"Mariette, Andersson/0000-0002-9769-5288","Center for Advanced Biofuel Systems, an Energy Frontier Research Center - US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0001295]","We thank Brian Waters (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) for critical reading and editing of the manuscript.

In order to assess the contribution of LPAATs to the synthesis of storage lipids, we have characterized two microsomal LPAAT isozymes, the products of homoeologous genes that are expressed in rapeseed (Brassica napus). DNA sequence homologies, complementation of a bacterial LPAAT-deficient mutant, and enzymatic properties confirmed that each of two cDNAs isolated from a Brassica napus immature embryo library encoded a functional LPAAT possessing the properties of a eukaryotic pathway enzyme. Analyses in planta revealed differences in the expression of the two genes, one of which was detected in all rapeseed tissues and during silique and seed development, whereas the expression of the second gene was restricted predominantly to siliques and developing seeds. Expression of each rapeseed LPAAT isozyme in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in the production of seeds characterized by a greater lipid content and seed mass. These results support the hypothesis that increasing the expression of glycerolipid acyltransferases in seeds leads to a greater flux of intermediates through the Kennedy pathway and results in enhanced triacylglycerol accumulation.","[Maisonneuve, Sylvie; Delseny, Michel; Roscoe, Thomas J.] Univ Perpignan, CNRS UP IRD UMR 5096, Lab Genome & Dev Plantes, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Bessoule, Jean-Jacques; Lessire, Rene] Univ Bordeaux 2, CNRS, Lab Biogenese Membranaire, UMR 5200, F-33076 Bordeaux, France",,"Roscoe, TJ (corresponding author), Inst Rech Dev Ctr Montpellier, 911 Ave Agropolis BP5045, F-34032 Montpellier 1, France.",France,Europe,Global North,thomas.roscoe@ird.fr,"guyot, romain/M-1118-2015","guyot, romain/0000-0002-7016-7485",French Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie; Organisation Nationale Interprofessionelle des Oleagineux [BOU0049],This work was supported by the French Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie and the Organisation Nationale Interprofessionelle des Oleagineux (grant no.

The transfer DNA insertion mutant lpeat2 and the double mutant lpeat1 lpeat2 showed impaired growth, smaller leaves, shorter roots, less seed setting, and reduced lipid content per fresh weight in roots and seeds and large increases in LPE and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) contents in leaves. Microsomal preparations from leaves of these mutants showed around 70% decrease in acylation activity of LPE with 16:0-CoA compared with wild-type membranes, whereas the acylation with 18:1-CoA was much less affected, demonstrating that other lysophospholipid acyltransferases than the two LPEATs could acylate LPE. The above-mentioned effects were less pronounced in the single lpeat1 mutant. Overexpression of either LPEAT1 or LPEAT2 under the control of the 35S promotor led to morphological changes opposite to what was seen in the transfer DNA mutants. Acyl specificity studies showed that LPEAT1 utilized 16:0-CoA at the highest rate of 11 tested acyl-CoAs, whereas LPEAT2 utilized 20:0-CoA as the best acyl donor. Both LPEATs could acylate either sn position of ether analogs of LPC. The data show that the activities of LPEAT1 and LPEAT2 are, in a complementary way, involved in growth regulation in Arabidopsis. It is shown that LPEAT activity (especially LPEAT2) is essential for maintaining adequate levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, LPE, and LPC in the cells.","[Jasieniecka-Gazarkiewicz, Katarzyna; Banas, Antoni] Univ Gdansk, Intercollegiate Fac Biotechnol, PL-80307 Gdansk, Poland; [Jasieniecka-Gazarkiewicz, Katarzyna; Banas, Antoni] Med Univ Gdansk, PL-80307 Gdansk, Poland; [Lager, Ida; Carlsson, Anders S.; Stymne, Sten] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Breeding, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Gutbrod, Katharina; Peisker, Helga; Doermann, Peter] Univ Bonn, Inst Mol Physiol & Biotechnol Plants, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",,"Banas, A (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Intercollegiate Fac Biotechnol, PL-80307 Gdansk, Poland.; Banas, A (corresponding author), Med Univ Gdansk, PL-80307 Gdansk, Poland.",Poland,Europe,Global North,antoni.banas@biotech.ug.edu.pl,,"Carlsson, Anders/0000-0002-8525-9753; Banas, Antoni/0000-0001-9397-7627; Jasieniecka-Gazarkiewicz, Katarzyna/0000-0002-7682-188X",Strategic Research Area project Trees and Crops for the Future; Foundation for Strategic Research project Oil Crops for the Future,This work was supported by the Strategic Research Area project Trees and Crops for the Future and by the Foundation for Strategic Research project Oil Crops for the Future.,34,14,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,JUN,2017,174,2,10.1104/pp.17.00391,Plant Sciences,EX3SH,WOS:000403152200043,28408542,"Bronze, Green Published",

To begin to characterize chemical diversity in the genus, seed oil content and fatty acid composition were determined for 9 species, with representatives from the three major recognized clades. All species produced very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) as major components of the seed triacylglycerol (TAG) oil, with considerable diversity of fatty acid chain length. The 22-carbon (C22) monounsaturated fatty acid erucic acid (cis-13-docosenoic acid) was the dominant VLCFA in the oil of Heliophila coronopifolia at 47.6% of total seed fatty acids whereas the unusual C26 fatty acid ximenic acid (cis-17hexacosenoic acid) dominated the VLCFA profile of oil from 1 leliophila scoparia at 35.8%. 1 leliophila ofricana oil was identified as a potential novel source of the nutraceutical fatty acid, nervonic acid (cis-15-tetracosenoic acid). Analysis of the oil of 3 species by sn-1,3 regioselective lipase digestion demonstrated the virtual exclusion of VLCTAs from the sn-2 position of TAG. Examination of the oil from 11. scoparia by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALD1-TOF) Mass Spectrometry revealed the presence of high molecular weight TAGs and widespread distribution of VLCFAs among the TAG molecular species. Heliophila species have significant potential as sources of novel seed oil enriched in VLCFAs and as model species to study the mechanisms and evolution of VLCFA biosynthesis in plants.

The present study was planned to investigate the effect of inoculation of plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains IG 3 (Klebsiella sp.), IG 10 (Enterobacter ludwigii) and IG 15 (Flavobacterium sp.) in improving drought tolerance in wheat. These PGPR strains were screened for drought tolerance in nutrient broth supplemented with different concentrations (0-25%) of polyethylene glycol (PEG6000). Effect of PGPR inoculation on various physiological, biochemical parameters and gene expression of stress responsive genes were studied under drought stress. Root colonization at the surface and interiors of roots was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tetrazolium staining, respectively. Drought stress significantly affected various growth parameters, water status, membrane integrity, osmolyte accumulation and stress-responsive gene expressions, which were positively altered by PGPR-inoculation in wheat. Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR analysis revealed the up regulation of some stress-related genes (DREB2A and CAT1) in un-inoculated wheat plants exposed to drought stress. PGPR-inoculated plants showed attenuated transcript levels suggesting improved drought tolerance due to interaction of PGPRs.

Previous studies demonstrated that MdACS1 and MdACS3a, which encode 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthases (ACS), are crucial in apple fruit ethylene production. MdACS1 is well-known to be intimately involved in the climacteric ethylene burst in fruit ripening, while MdACS3a has been regarded a main regulator for ethylene production transition from system 1 (during fruit development) to system 2 (during fruit ripening). However, MdACS3a was also shown to have limited roles in initiating the ripening process lately. To better assess their roles, fruit ethylene production and softening were evaluated at five time points during a 20-day post-harvest period in 97 Malus accessions and in 34 progeny from 2 controlled crosses. Allelotyping was accomplished using an existing marker (ACS1) for MdACS1 and two markers (CAPS(866) and CAPS(870)) developed here to specifically detect the two null alleles (ACS3a-G289V and Mdacs3a) of MdACS3a. In total, 952 Malus accessions were allelotyped with the three markers. The major findings included: The effect of MdACS1 was significant on fruit ethylene production and softening while that of MdACS3a was less detectable; allele MdACS1-2 was significantly associated with low ethylene and slow softening; under the same background of the MdACS1 allelotypes, null allele Mdacs3a (not ACS3a-G289V) could confer a significant delay of ethylene peak; alleles MdACS1-2 and Mdacs3a (excluding ACS3a-G289V) were highly enriched in M. domestica and M. hybrid when compared with those in M. sieversii. These findings are of practical implications in developing apples of low and delayed ethylene profiles by utilizing the beneficial alleles MdACS1-2 and Mdacs3a.","[Dougherty, Laura; Zhu, Yuandi; Xu, Kenong] Cornell Univ, New York State Agr Expt Stn, Hort Sect, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; [Zhu, Yuandi] China Agr Univ, Dept Pomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",,"Xu, KN (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, New York State Agr Expt Stn, Hort Sect, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Geneva, NY 14456 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,kx27@cornell.edu,,"Dougherty, Laura/0000-0002-1974-7644",,,36,11,NANJING AGRICULTURAL UNIV,NANJING,"NO 1 WEIGANG, NANJING, JIANGSU 210095, PEOPLES R CHINA",2662-6810,2052-7276,18-May,2016,3,,10.1038/hortres.2016.24,Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Horticulture,DN3UH,WOS:000376988800001,27231553,"Green Published, gold",

Ethylene induces fruit ripening in climacteric fruits, such as coffee, being directly involved in fruit ripening time and synchronization. Coffee early cultivars usually show a more uniform ripening process although little is known about the genetic factors that promote the earliness of ripening. Thus, this work aimed to characterize the putative members of the coffee (Coffea arabica) ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathways, as well as to analyze the expression patterns of these members during fruit ripening of early (Catucai 785-15) and late (Acau) coffee cultivars. Reverse Transcription-qPCR analysis of the four biosynthesis genes (CaACS1-like; CaACO1-like; CaACO4-like e CaACO5-like) analyzed in this study showed that CaACO1-like and CaACO4-like displayed an expression pattern typically observed in climacteric fruits, being up-regulated during ripening. CaACS1-like gene expression was also up-regulated during fruit ripening of both cultivars, although in a much lesser extent when compared to the changes in CaACO1-like and CaACO4-like gene expression. CaACO5-like was only induced in raisin fruit and may be related to senescence processes. On the other hand, members of the ethylene signaling pathway (CaETR1-like, CaETR4-like, CaCTR2-like, CaEIN2-like, CaEIN3-like, CaERF1) showed slightly higher expression levels during the initial stages of development (green and yellow-green fruits), except for the ethylene receptors CaETR1-like and CaETR4-like, which were constitutively expressed and induced in cherry fruits, respectively. The higher ethylene production levels in Catucai 785-15 fruits, indicated by the expression analysis of CaACO1-like and CaACO4-like, suggest that it promotes an enhanced CaETR4-like degradation, leading to an increase in ethylene sensitivity and consequently to an earliness in the ripening process of this cultivar. Ethylene production in Acau fruits may not be sufficient to inactivate the CaETR4-like levels and thus ripening changes occur in a slower pace. Thus, the expression analysis of the ethylene biosynthesis and signaling genes suggests that ethylene is directly involved in the determination of the ripening time of coffee fruits, and CaACO1-like, CaACO4-like and CaETR4-like may display essential roles during coffee fruit ripening.","[Sagio, Solange A.; Barreto, Horllys G.; Lima, Andre A.; Moreira, Rafael O.; Rezende, Pamela M.; Chalfun-Junior, Antonio] Fed Univ L avras UFLA, Plant Mol Physiol Lab, Dept Biol, BR-30373720 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Paiva, Luciano V.] Cent Lab Mol Biol LCBM, Dept Chem, BR-30373720 Lavras, MG, Brazil",,"Chalfun, A (corresponding author), Fed Univ L avras UFLA, Plant Mol Physiol Lab, Dept Biol, BR-30373720 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",Brazil,South America,Global South,chalfunjunior@dbi.ufla.br,"Chalfun, Antonio/AAG-8609-2021; Paiva, Luciano/AAU-3333-2020; Moreira, Rafael Oliveira/P-6411-2015; Chalfun-Junior, Antonio/I-5655-2013; Lima, Andre/D-9138-2018","Chalfun-Junior, Antonio/0000-0002-1794-9429; Lima, Andre/0000-0002-3262-7858; Moreira, Rafael/0000-0002-2574-2292",,,80,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0032-0935,1432-2048,MAY,2014,239,5,10.1007/s00425-014-2026-1,Plant Sciences,AG1EU,WOS:000335158700002,24435496,Closed,Closed

T repens (L; white clover), is described. In common with observations made in T repens, the ACO genes displayed differential expression, with a TR-ACO2-like gene (designated TO-ACO2) confined to developing and early mature-green leaf tissue while expression of a TR-ACO3-like gene (designated TO-ACO3) is highest in leaves at the onset and during senescence. Biochemical analysis of TO-ACO2 revealed that both accumulation of the protein (determined by western analysis with a TR-ACO2 antibody) and enzyme activity matched the transcriptional activity of TO-ACO2. Western analysis also revealed that the Tr-ACO2 antibody recognised a protein of 37 kDa as a putative TP-ACO2 in T. pallescens. The 3'-UTRs of TO-ACO2 and TO-ACO3 were then compared with the 3'-UTRs of a 7R-ACO2-like and TR-ACO3-like gene from T. pallescens, the other proposed ancestral genome (or closely related to the ancestor) of T. repens, with identity values of 87.8% for the ACO2-like genes and 94.8% for the ACO3-like genes. Comparison of the 3'-UTRs of TO-ACO2 with a TO-ACO2-like gene in T. repens (designated TR(O)-ACO2) and TP-ACO2 with a TP-ACO2-like gene in T. repens (designated 7R(P)-ACO2) revealed identities of 100% and 96.6%, respectively, lending good support to T. occidentale as one of the ancestral genomes of T. repens. A similar comparison of the 3'-UTRs of TO-ACO3 with a TO-ACO3-like gene in T repens (designated TR(O)-ACO3) and TP-ACO3 with a TP-ACO3-like gene in T repens (designated TR(P)-ACO3) revealed identities of 99.5% and 97.9%, respectively, again supporting T. occidentale as one of the ancestral genomes. Further, these data confirm that both TO-ACO-like and TP-ACO-like genes are expressed in the allotetraploid I repens. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although tobacco is a self-compatible species, it displays unilateral incongruity with other Nicotiana plants. Incongruous pollination also results in ethylene production, but this production differs depending on the pollen used and is related to the extent to which pollen tubes grow in the tobacco style. In the investigation reported here we followed the expression of the ACC synthase- and ACC oxidase-coding genes upon pollination of tobacco pistils and compared self-pollination with incongruous pollination. The pattern of expression of these genes also correlated with pollen-tube growth, although wounding alone cannot explain the results obtained. We also examined the expression of these genes upon pollination of immature tobacco pistils, in which different pollen tubes grew indistinctly inside the tobacco style and reached the ovary at the same rate. In this situation no significant differences in gene expression could be observed between the different pollinations. Ethephon, a substance that produces ethylene, could, in some cases, minimize the arrest of incongruous pollen tubes inside the style.","Catholic Univ Nijmegen, Dept Expt Bot, Grad Sch Expt Plant Sci, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",,"Mariani, C (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Nijmegen, Dept Expt Bot, Grad Sch Expt Plant Sci, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Europe,Global North,,"Mariani, Celestina/C-6920-2013","FCCN, Bogus2/0000-0003-0267-2276; Sanchez, Ana/0000-0002-0444-7278",,,22,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4412,,MAR,2002,48,4,10.1023/A:1014087914652,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,519CB,WOS:000173706400003,11905962,,

The prevailing view is that sugars provide respirable substrates, structural constituents and osmolytes; however, interaction with plant hormone ethylene seems to be more important for several ethylene-sensitive flowers. To determine whether and how sugars interact with ethylene to regulate postharvest flower senescence in Paeonia suffruticosa, a traditional ornamental plant in China with most ethylene-sensitive cultivars, we investigated the effects of glucose on ethylene biosynthesis and sensitivity in relation to postharvest flower development. Cut P. suffruticosa flowers continuously treated with glucose, but not the osmolyte mannitol, showed delayed visible senescence and extended vase life. Glucose treatment delayed and inhibited the climacteric increase in ethylene production of cut flowers associated with the delay and inhibition of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) activity, as well as the suppression of ACC oxidase (ACO) activity in petals, which is at least partially explained by the repression of PsACS1 mRNA accumulation. Exposure of cut flowers to ethylene shortened vase life and stimulated autocatalytic ethylene production. However, these effects of ethylene were markedly reduced in the flowers with prior glucose treatment rather than mannitol, suggesting that glucose directly decreases the sensitivity to ethylene. Additionally, glucose prevented the effect of ethylene in inducing PsACS1 mRNA accumulation but did not affect P5AC01 mRNA level. These results indicate that glucose extends the vase life of cut P. suffruticosa flowers, possibly through both a delay and inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis, and a decrease in sensitivity to ethylene.

Taken advantage that Penicillium expansum is the compatible pathogen and P. digitatum is the non-host of apples, the present study aimed at deciphering how each Penicillium spp. could interfere in the fruit ethylene biosynthesis at the biochemical and molecular level. The infection capacity and different aspects related to the ethylene biosynthesis were conducted at different times post-inoculation. The results show that the fruit ethylene biosynthesis was differently altered during the P. expansum infection than in response to other biotic (non-host pathogen P. digitatum) or abiotic stresses (wounding). The first symptoms of the disease due to P. expansum were visible before the initiation of the fruit ethylene climacteric burst. Indeed, the ethylene climacteric burst was reduced in response to P. expansum concomitant to an important induction of MdAC03 gene expression and an inhibition (ca. 3 fold) and overexpression (ca. 2-fold) of ACO (1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase) and ACS (1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase) enzyme activities, indicating a putative role of MdAC03 in the P. expansum-apple interaction which may, in turn, be related to System-1 ethylene biosynthesis. System-1 is auto-inhibited by ethylene and is characteristic of non-climateric or pre-climacteric fruit. Accordingly, we hypothesise that P. expansum may 'manipulate' the endogenous ethylene biosynthesis in apples, leading to the circumvention or suppression of effective defences hence facilitating its colonization.

In this study, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) MADS-box gene, SlMADS1, was cloned and its tissue-specific expression profile was analyzed. The real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that SlMADS1 was highly expressed in sepals and fruits; its expression level was increased with the development of sepals, while the transcript of SlMADS1 decreased significantly in accordance with fruit ripening. To further explore the function of SlMADS1, an RNA interference (RNAi) expression vector targeting SlMADS1 was constructed and transformed into tomato plants. Shorter ripening time of fruit was observed in SlMADS1-silenced tomatoes. The accumulation of carotenoid and the expression of PHYTOENE SYNTHETASE1 were enhanced in RNAi fruits. Besides, ethylene biosynthetic genes, including 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE1A, 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE6, 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE OXIDASE1, and 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE OXIDASE3, and the ethylene-responsive genes E4 and E8, which were involved in fruit ripening, were also up-regulated in silenced plants. SlMADS1 RNAi fruits showed approximately 2- to 4-fold increases in ethylene production compared with the wild type. Furthermore, SlMADS1-silenced seedlings displayed shorter hypocotyls and were more sensitive to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate than the wild type. Additionally, a yeast two-hybrid assay revealed a clear interaction between SlMADS1 and SlMADS-RIN. These results suggest that SlMADS1 plays an important role in fruit ripening as a repressive modulator.","[Dong, Tingting; Hu, Zongli; Deng, Lei; Wang, Yi; Zhu, Mingku; Zhang, Jianling; Chen, Guoping] Chongqing Univ, Bioengn Coll, Key Lab Biorheol Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China",,"Chen, GP (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Bioengn Coll, Key Lab Biorheol Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,chenguoping@cqu.edu.cn,"Deng, Lei/AAQ-1096-2021; 朱, 明库/ABD-8211-2021","Deng, Lei/0000-0001-9415-3961; Wang, Yi/0000-0002-4706-8171","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31000911, 31171968]; Doctoral Program Foundation of the Institutions of Higher Education of China [20100191110031]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [CDJXS11232244]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31000911 and 31171968), the Doctoral Program Foundation of the Institutions of Higher Education of China (grant no. 20100191110031), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant no.

Our previous studies indicated that two rose (Rosa hybrida) 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase genes, RhACS1 and RhACS2, play a role in dehydration-induced ethylene production and inhibition of cell expansion in rose petals. Here, both RhACS1 and RhACS2 promoters were analyzed using histochemical staining and glucuronidase synthase (GUS) gene reporter activity assays following their introduction into transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. It was found that the promoter activities of both genes were strong throughout the course of development from young seedlings to mature flowering plants in various organs, including hypocotyls, cotyledons, leaves, roots and lateral roots. RhACS1 promoter activity was induced by drought in both rosette leaves and roots of transgenic A. thaliana lines, but was reduced following a re-hydration treatment. In contrast, RhACS2 promoter activity was decreased by drought in rosette leaves, while its response pattern was similar to that of RhACS1 in roots. A mannitol treatment induced the activity of both the RhACS1 and RhACS2 promoters, indicating that both genes are also regulated by osmotic stress. In addition, RhACS2 appeared to be abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible, while RhACS1 was less sensitive to ABA. Finally, four truncated sequences of the RhACS1 promoter were generated and GUS activity assays demonstrated that deleting a 327 bp region between bp 862 and -535 resulted in a substantial decrease of the promoter activity. Taken together, our results suggest that the RhACS1 and RhACS2 promoters respond to abiotic stresses in a developmentally regulated and spatially specific manner.","[Khan, Muhammad Ali; Meng, Yonglu; Liu, Daofeng; Tang, Hongshu; Lu, Suhui; Imtiaz, Muhammad; Jiang, Guimei; Lu, Peitao; Ji, Yuqi; Gao, Junping; Ma, Nan] China Agr Univ, Dept Ornamental Hort, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Khan, Muhammad Ali; Imtiaz, Muhammad] Univ Agr Peshawar, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan",,"Ma, N (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Ornamental Hort, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,ma_nan@cau.edu.cn,"Lü, Peitao/B-4641-2019","Lu, Peitao/0000-0002-4894-6458","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31372095, 31130048]; 948 project of the Ministry of Agriculture [2011-G17]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant 31372095 and Grant 31130048, and the 948 project (2011-G17) of the Ministry of Agriculture.

ACC synthase gene (VR-ACS6) was specifically activated by auxin and the response was modulated by several plant hormones. A 400 bp truncated promoter region of VR-ACS6/GUS chimeric construct was tested for auxin inducibility and hormonal responses in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun). The truncated promoter (-214 to +186) of VR-ACS6 gene showed similar GUS expression level as the full-length promoter (-1531 to +186) without indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) treatment. The truncated promoter had the same positive response to IAA as the full-length promoter and a negative response to methyl jasmonate and abscissic acid. Interestingly, the brassinosteroid (BR) effect on the promoter was remarkably different between etiolated and green seedlings. Maximum GUS activity was found at 10 muM IAA in etiolated seedlings, whereas maximum GUS activity was detected at 0.1 muM IAA in the IAA dose-response curve for the green seedlings. When the etiolated seedlings were de-etiolated, the IAA dose-response curve changed completely. Furthermore, the enhancer effect of BR shown in etiolated seedlings was eliminated in green seedlings. These results suggest that light signals might modulate the promoter activity of VR-ACS6 possibly via interaction with other hormonal signals.

Here, we describe timecourse tomato transcriptional responses to spider mite feeding and compare them with Arabidopsis in order to determine conserved and divergent defense responses to this pest. To refine the involvement of jasmonic acid (JA) in mite-induced responses and to improve tomato Gene Ontology annotations, we analyzed transcriptional changes in the tomato JA-signaling mutant defenseless1 (def-1) upon JA treatment and spider mite herbivory. Overlay of differentially expressed genes (DEG) identified in def-1 onto those from the timecourse experiment established that JA controls expression of the majority of genes differentially regulated by herbivory. Comparison of defense responses between tomato and Arabidopsis highlighted 96 orthologous genes (of 2,133 DEG) that were recruited for defense against spider mites in both species. These genes, involved in biosynthesis of JA, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and terpenoids, represent the conserved core of induced defenses. The remaining tomato DEG support the establishment of tomato-specific defenses, indicating profound divergence of spider mite-induced responses between tomato and Arabidopsis.","[Martel, Catherine; Zhurov, Vladimir; Navarro, Marie; Cazaux, Marc; Estrella Santamaria, M.; Grbic, Miodrag; Grbic, Vojislava] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Navarro, Marie; Cazaux, Marc; Grbic, Miodrag; Grbic, Vojislava] Inst Ciencias Vid & Vino, Logrono 26006, Spain; [Martinez, Manuel; Estrella Santamaria, M.; Diaz, Isabel] Univ Politecn Madrid, Ctr Biotecnol & Genom Plantas, Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Auger, Philippe; Migeon, Alain; Navajas, Maria] UMR CBGP INRA IRD Cirad Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, F-34998 Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Wybouw, Nicky; Van Leeuwen, Thomas] Univ Ghent, Dept Crop Protect, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Leeuwen, Thomas] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Grbic, V (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",Canada,North America,Global North,vgrbic@uwo.ca,"Martinez, Manuel/I-8743-2014; Diaz, Isabel/I-8840-2014; SANTAMARIA, Mª ESTRELLA/I-9337-2014; NAVAJAS, Maria/AAM-2294-2020","Martinez, Manuel/0000-0002-7826-5872; Diaz, Isabel/0000-0001-9865-902X; SANTAMARIA, Mª ESTRELLA/0000-0003-4999-6227; NAVAJAS, Maria/0000-0002-0702-4238; Migeon, Alain/0000-0003-4041-5158; Martel, Catherine/0000-0001-8777-0857; Van Leeuwen, Thomas/0000-0003-4651-830X; Wybouw, Nicky/0000-0001-7874-9765; Zhurov, Vladimir/0000-0002-7120-4655","Government of Canada through Genome CanadaGenome Canada; Ontario Genomics Institute [OGI-046]; Ontario Research Fund-Global Leadership in Genomics and Life Sciences [GL2-01-035]; French Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR 2010 BLAN 1715 02]; FWOFWO [3G061011, 3G009312]; Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in FlandersInstitute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT) [IWT/SB/101451]","This project was funded by the Government of Canada through Genome Canada and the Ontario Genomics Institute (OGI-046) (to M.

The induction of resistance was enhanced 6 days after elicitation and when the antagonist was used in a concentration of 10(5) conidia per ml. Th003 application in seed priming and nursery significantly stimulated plant growth. Gene expression induced by Th003 was evaluated using the tomato TOM1 microarray. Plant treatment with T. koningiopsis affected mRNA levels of 45 genes: 41 in roots and 4 in leaves.

FRUIT; OXIDASE; STRESS,"Persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) fruit are usually classified as climacteric fruit; however, unlike typical climacteric fruits, persimmon fruit exhibit a unique characteristic in that the younger the stage of fruit detached, the greater the level of ethylene produced. To investigate ethylene induction mechanisms in detached young persimmon fruit, we cloned three cDNAs encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (DK-ACS1, 2, and -3) and two encoding ACC oxidase (DK-ACO1 and -2) genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, and we analyzed their expression in various fruit tissues. Ethylene production was induced within a few days of detachment in all fruit tissues tested, accompanied by temporally and spatially coordinated expression of all the DK-ACS and DK-ACO genes. In all tissues except the calyx, treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene, an inhibitor of ethylene action, suppressed ethylene production and ethylene biosynthesis-related gene expression. In the calyx, one ACC synthase gene (DK-ACS2) exhibited increased mRNA accumulation accompanied by a large quantity of ethylene production, and treatment of the fruit with 1-methylcyclopropene did not prevent either the accumulation of DK-ACS2 transcripts or ethylene induction. Furthermore, the alleviation of water loss from the fruit significantly delayed the onset of ethylene production and the expression of DK-ACS2 in the calyx. These results indicate that ethylene biosynthesis in detached young persimmon fruit is initially induced in calyx and is modulated by water loss through transcriptional activation of DK-ACS2. The ethylene produced in the calyx subsequently diffuses to other fruit tissues and acts as a secondary signal that stimulates autocatalytic ethylene biosynthesis in these tissues, leading to a burst of ethylene production.","Okayama Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Postharvest Agr, Okayama 7008530, Japan",,"Nakano, R (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Postharvest Agr, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,,,"KUBO, Yasutaka/0000-0002-2442-6829; NAKANO, Ryohei/0000-0001-5042-1725",,,59,114,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,JAN,2003,131,1,10.1104/pp.010462,Plant Sciences,638UH,WOS:000180589500030,12529535,"Green Published, Bronze",

Tolerance of plants to flooding can be achieved through different molecular, physiological and anatomical adaptations, which will affect their water uptake capacity and therefore their root hydraulic properties. Here, we investigated the root hydraulic properties under non-flooded and flooded conditions in non-mycorrhizal tomato plants and plants inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Only flooded mycorrhizal plants increased their root hydraulic conductivity, and this effect was correlated with a higher expression of the plant aquaporin SlPIP1;7 and the fungal aquaporin GintAQP1. There was also a higher abundance of the PIP2 protein phoshorylated at Ser280 in mycorrhizal flooded plants. The role of plant hormones (ethylene, ABA and IAA) in root hydraulic properties was also taken into consideration, and it was concluded that, in mycorrhizal flooded plants, ethylene has a secondary role regulating root hydraulic conductivity whereas IAA may be the key hormone that allows the enhancement of root hydraulic conductivity in mycorrhizal plants under low oxygen conditions.","[Calvo-Polanco, Monica; Molina, Sonia; Aroca, Ricardo] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Dept Soil Microbiol & Symbiot Syst, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [Maria Zamarreno, Angel; Maria Garcia-Mina, Jose] CIPAV TimacAGRO Int Roullier Grp, Navarra 31160, Spain",,"Calvo-Polanco, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Dept Soil Microbiol & Symbiot Syst, C Prof Albareda 1, E-18008 Granada, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,monica.calvo@eez.csic.es,"Calvo-Polanco, Monica/AAN-9952-2020; García-Mina, José María/O-7577-2014; Zamarreño, Angel/F-7236-2016; Aroca, Ricardo/K-5268-2014","Calvo-Polanco, Monica/0000-0002-0813-0921; García-Mina, José María/0000-0001-6352-9612; Zamarreño, Angel/0000-0003-1966-0239; Aroca, Ricardo/0000-0003-2402-2063",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of SpainSpanish Government [AGL2011-25403]; Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [P10-CVI-5920],This study was supported by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [Juan de la Cierva Program and AGL2011-25403 project]; and the Junta de Andalucia [P10-CVI-5920 project].,74,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,1471-9053,MAY,2014,55,5,10.1093/pcp/pcu035,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,AH9VB,WOS:000336491400012,24553847,,

Cucumber has a unique genetic system for gynoecious sex expression, which is determined by the copy number variation (CNV)-based, dominant, and dosage-dependent femaleness (F) locus. However, this gynoecy expression system seems unstable since monecious plants could often be found in F-dependent gynoecious cucumber inbreds. We hypothesized that gynoecy instability (gynoecy loss) may be due to unequal crossing over (UCO) during meiosis among repeat units of the CNV. In this study, using high throughput genome resequencing, fiber-FISH and genomic qPCR analyses, we first confirmed and refined the structure of the F locus, which was a CNV of a 30.2-kb tandem repeat. Gynoecious plants contained three genes: CsACS1, CsACS1G, and CsMYB, of which CsACS1G is a duplication of CsACS1 but with a recombinant distal promoter that may contribute to gynoecy sex expression. In two large populations from self-pollinated gynoecious inbred lines, 'gynoecy loss' mutants were identified with similar mutation rates (similar to 0.12%). We show that these monecious mutants have lost CsACS1G. In addition, we identified gynoecious lines in natural populations that carry two copies of CSACS1G. We proposed a model to explain gynoecy instability in F-dependent cucumbers, which is caused by UCO among CSACS1/G units during meiosis. The findings present a convincing case that the phenotypic variation of an economically important trait is associated with the dynamic changes of copy numbers at the F locus. This work also has important implications in cucumber breeding.","[Li, Zheng; Han, Yonghua; Wang, Yuhui; Jiang, Biao; Weng, Yiqun] Univ Wisconsin, Hort Dept, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Li, Zheng; Niu, Huanhuan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Hort, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Han, Yonghua] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Integrat Plant Biol, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Biao] Guangdong Acad Agr Sci, Vegetable Res Inst, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Weng, Yiqun] USDA ARS, Vegetable Crops Res Unit, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Weng, YQ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Hort Dept, Madison, WI 53706 USA.; Weng, YQ (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Vegetable Crops Res Unit, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,yiqun.weng@wisc.edu,"Wang, Yuhui/AAT-5313-2021",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672150, 31872111]; Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities [2452016004]; Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province [2018NY-034]; USDA National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2015-51181-24285, 2017-67013-26195]","The work in Z.L.'s lab was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 31672150 and 31872111), the Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities (2452016004), and the Key Research and Development Plan (2018NY-034) of Shaanxi Province.

To test whether cytokinin controls plant development through inhibiting an early step in the auxin response pathway, we compared the effects of cytokinin with those of the dgt (diageotropica) mutation, which is known to block rapid auxin reactions of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) hypocotyls. Long-term cytokinin treatment of wild-type seedlings phenocopied morphological traits of dgt plants such as stunting of root and shoot growth, reduced elongation of internodes, reduced apical dominance, and reduced leaf size and complexity. Cytokinin treatment also inhibited rapid auxin responses in hypocotyl segments: auxin-stimulated elongation, H+ secretion, and ethylene synthesis were all inhibited by cytokinin in wild-type hypocotyl segments, and thus mimicked the impaired auxin responsiveness found in dgt hypocotyls. However, cytokinin failed to inhibit auxin-induced LeSAUR gene expression, an auxin response that is affected by the dgt mutation. In addition, cytokinin treatment inhibited the auxin induction of only one of two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase genes that exhibited impaired auxin inducibility in dgt hypocotyls. Thus, cytokinin inhibited a subset of the auxin responses impaired in dgt hypocotyls, suggesting that cytokinin blocks at least one branch of the DGT-dependent auxin response pathway.","Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Univ Hamburg, Inst Allgemeine Bot, D-22609 Hamburg, Germany; Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Ctr Gene Res & Biotechnol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"Coenen, C (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,ccoenen@allegheny.edu,,,,,65,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,APR,2003,131,4,10.1104/pp.102.016196,Plant Sciences,717FQ,WOS:000185076400019,12692328,"Green Published, Bronze",

Here, we have studied the differential transcript accumulation pattern and protein levels of MA-ACS1 and MA-ACO1 genes in response to ethylene, auxin, wounding and low temperature in preclimacteric banana fruit. We have shown that exogenous application of ethylene and auxin induced the expression of MA-ACS1 while MA-ACO1 showed marginal expression following ethylene treatment in preclimacteric stage. Auxin did not induce MA-ACO1 expression. Thus, auxin-treated banana fruits showed lower ethylene production rate as compared to ethylene-treated fruits. Conversely, wounding and cold treatment down-regulated the expression of both the genes and thus inhibited ethylene production. Furthermore, we have detected a GCC-box putative ethylene-responsive element (ERE)- and an auxin-responsive element (ARE)-specific DNA-binding activity in the banana pulp and studied the ethylene and auxin responsive characteristics of the GCC-box and ARE (TGTCTC) containing synthetic promoter fragments. In addition, we have detected an enhanced ethylene production rate and expression level of MA-ACS1 and MA-ACO1 genes along with a strong GCC-box-specific DNA-binding activity following exposure to constant dark period for 8d at the preclimacteric stage. Together, our study provides interesting information about the regulation of expression of MA-ACS1 and MA-ACO1 genes in response to various factors during ripening in banana fruit, which may have physiological relevance concerning ethylene biosynthesis during post-harvest conditions.

We have investigated the regulation of pollination-induced ethylene synthesis in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) using flowers of the dialytic (dl) mutant, in which pollination can be manipulated experimentally, with the aim of developing a model system to study tomato flower senescence. Ethylene synthesis increased rapidly in dl pistils following pollination, leading to accelerated petal senescence, and was delayed in ethylene-insensitive Never ripe (Nu) pistils. However, NY pistils eventually produced more ethylene than dl pistils, suggesting the presence of negative feedback regulation of ethylene synthesis following pollination. LEACS1A expression correlated well with increased ethylene production in pollinated dl pistils, and expression in Nr revealed that regulation is via an ethylene-independent mechanism. In contrast, the induction of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidases, LEACO1 and LEACO3, following pollination is ethylene dependent. In addition, the expression profiles of ACS and ACO genes were determined during petal senescence and a hypothesis proposed that translocated 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid from the pistil may be important for regulating the initial burst of ethylene production during petal senescence, These results are discussed and differences between tomato and the ornamental species previously studied are highlighted.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol Sci, Plant Sci Div, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England",,"Grierson, D (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol Sci, Plant Sci Div, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England.",England,Europe,Global North,Donald.Grierson@nottingham.ac.uk,"Barry, Cornelius/D-7759-2012","Barry, Cornelius/0000-0003-4685-0273",,,51,99,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,JUL,2000,123,3,10.1104/pp.123.3.971,Plant Sciences,334YD,WOS:000088213300019,10889245,"Bronze, Green Published",

RNA protection assays revealed that mRNAs for LE-ACS1A and LE-ACS6 rapidly accumulated during the first 2 h of ozone exposure and then abruptly disappeared. Levels of mRNA for LE-ACS2 increased with 1-h lag and was maintained at high levels after 2 h. Patterns of their expression were similar to those observed in wounded leaves and in elicitor-treated cells. But level of the transcript for wound-inducible proteinase inhibitor II was undetectable during the ozone exposure, suggesting that similar biochemical reactions involved in elicitor signaling might be participating in the induction of ACC synthase by ozone treatment. The rate of ethylene production and the level of mRNA for LE-ACO1 were increased and then maintained at high levels during ozone exposure, while the induction of ACC synthase activity was transient and decreased to the initial level at the end of ozone exposure. These results sugg -ACO I might regulate the rate of ethylene synthesis after ACC was sufficiently accumulated in leaf cells.

SS2 and SS4 plants grown in vitro under sealed microenvironment (SME) conditions displayed anomalous phenotypes including reduction of stem elongation, radial stem growth, and promotion of root hair formation in the generated root, which were similar to ethylene-induced responses. In addition, SS4 plants showed severe vitrification in developing leaves and elevated ethylene production under SME conditions. After the ethylene action inhibitor AgNO(3), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase (ACO) inhibitor CoCl(2), and ACC synthase inhibitor L-aminoethoxyvinylglycine were added to the growth media, the anomalous phenotypes in SS4 plants reverted to their normal phenotype with a concurrent decrease in ethylene production. Northern blot analysis showed that ACO transcripts in SS4 plants were constantly at high levels under normal and SME conditions, indicating that a high level of H(2)O(2) in SS4 plants up-regulates ACO transcripts. Moreover, the direct treatment of H(2)O(2) in potato plants confirmed the elevated expression of the ACO gene. Taken together, these data suggest that the high concentration of H(2)O(2) in transgenic potato plants stimulates ethylene biosynthesis by activating ACO gene expression.","[Kim, Yoon-Sik; Kim, Hyun-Soon; Lee, Yong-Hwa; Kim, Mi-Sun; Joung, Hyouk; Jeon, Jae-Heung] KRIBB, Plant Genome Res Ctr, Taejon 305806, South Korea; [Oh, Hyun-Woo] KRIBB, Insect Resources Res Ctr, Taejon 305806, South Korea; [Hahn, Kyu-Woong] Hannam Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Taejon 306791, South Korea",,"Jeon, JH (corresponding author), KRIBB, Plant Genome Res Ctr, Taejon 305806, South Korea.",South Korea,Asia,Global North,jeonjh@kribb.re.kr,,,,,41,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0721-7714,,JUN,2008,27,6,10.1007/s00299-008-0515-z,Plant Sciences,304CB,WOS:000256086500002,18273621,,

In this study, the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in Citrus sinensis-infected fruits and its putative involvement in an active defence response against P. digitatum infection is examined. Ethylene production is demonstrated as being the result of the co-ordinated and differential up-regulation of at least three ethylene biosynthetic genes: ACS1, ACS2, and ACO. Blocking ethylene perception by 1-MCP resulted in an increased ethylene production and ACS2 expression during infection and mechanical wounding, suggesting that this gene is negatively regulated by ethylene. ACO expression was induced by ethylene in the absence of wounding or infection, although further results indicate that its induction during the course of infection may not be primarily mediated by ethylene. Treatment with 1-MCP also increased susceptibility to Penicillium decay, showing an involvement of ethylene perception in promoting defence responses in citrus fruits. The changes in the expression of two defence-related genes up-regulated during infection were also studied: the ones coding for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and an acidic class II chitinase (ACR311). The onset of PAL expression after mechanical wounding or inoculation was not changed in 1-MCP-pretreated fruits, while its later increase during the course of infection was abolished. Chitinase gene induction was more related to mechanical damage and was partially repressed by ethylene. These studies indicate distinct possible regulatory mechanisms of plant fruit defence genes in the context of fungal infection and ethylene perception.","CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Ciencias Alimentos, E-46100 Valencia, Spain",,"Marcos, JF (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Ciencias Alimentos, Apartado Correos 73, E-46100 Valencia, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,jmarcos@iata.csic.es,"Gonzalez-Candelas, Luis/B-7998-2008; ZACARIAS, LORENZO/W-2510-2018; Marcos, Jose F./A-7121-2011","Gonzalez-Candelas, Luis/0000-0002-2579-6880; ZACARIAS, LORENZO/0000-0003-3982-8860; Marcos, Jose F./0000-0003-3339-2584",,,49,76,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0022-0957,1460-2431,AUG,2005,56,418,10.1093/jxb/eri218,Plant Sciences,945PB,WOS:000230513500020,15983011,Bronze,Bronze

Response to both compounds involves the modulation of ethylene sensitivity through ethylene receptor genes.Harvested Avena fatua caryopses are primary dormant and, therefore, germinated poorly at 20 degrees C. Karrikin 1 (KAR(1)), which action probably requires endogenous gibberellins (GAs), and gibberellin A(3) (GA(3)) was found to induce dormant caryopses to germinate. The stimulatory effects were accompanied by the activation of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and depended on undisturbed ethylene perception. KAR(1) and GA(3) promoted 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) accumulation during coleorhizae emergence and ethylene production shortly prior to the radicle protrusion, which resulted from the enhanced activity of two ethylene biosynthesis enzymes, ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO). The inhibitor of ACS adversely affected beneficial impacts of both KAR(1) and GA(3) on A. fatua caryopses germination, while the inhibitor of ACO more efficiently impeded the GA(3) effect. The inhibitors of ethylene action markedly lowered germination in response to KAR(1) and GA(3). Gene expression studies preceded by the identification of several genes related to ethylene biosynthesis (AfACS6, AfACO1, and AfACO5) and perception (AfERS1b, AfERS1c, AfERS2, AfETR2, AfETR3, and AfETR4) provided further evidence for the engagement of ethylene in KAR(1) and GA(3) induced germination of A. fatua caryopses. Both AfACO1 and AfACO5 were upregulated, whereas AfACS6 remained unaffected by the treatment. This suggests the existence of different regulatory mechanisms of enzymatic activity, transcriptional for ACO and non-transcriptional for ACS. During imbibition in water, AfERS1b was stronger expressed than other receptor genes. In the presence of KAR(1) or GA(3), the expression of AfETR3 was substantially induced. Differential expression of ethylene receptor genes implies the modulation of caryopses sensitivity adjusted to ethylene availability and suggests the functional diversification of individual receptors.","[Rudus, Izabela; Cembrowska-Lech, Danuta; Jaworska, Anna; Kepczynski, Jan] Univ Szczecin, Fac Biol, Dept Plant Physiol & Genet Engn, Waska 13, PL-71415 Szczecin, Poland",,"Kepczynski, J (corresponding author), Univ Szczecin, Fac Biol, Dept Plant Physiol & Genet Engn, Waska 13, PL-71415 Szczecin, Poland.",Poland,Europe,Global North,jankepcz@wp.pl,"Cembrowska-Lech, Danuta/AAX-9208-2020","Cembrowska-Lech, Danuta/0000-0002-1503-0064; Rudus, Izabela/0000-0003-3397-0209; Kepczynski, Jan/0000-0001-7841-0710","Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, PolandEuropean Commission [NN 310 726340]",The study was partly supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education Grant NN 310 726340.

The three treatments induce ethylene production in figs. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms responsible for oil, auxin and ethylene induced ethylene production in figs. The ethylene production in response to olive oil, auxin, and propylene treatments and during ripening were all induced by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and inhibited by propylene indicating a negative feedback regulation mechanism. Three 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase genes (Fc-ACS1, Fc-ACS2 and Fc-ACS3) and one ACC oxidase gene (Fc-ACO1) were isolated and their expression patterns in response to either oil, propylene or auxin treatment in figs determined. The expression patterns of Fc-ACS1 and Fc-ACO1 were clearly inhibited by 1-MCP and induced by propylene in oil treated and ripe fruits indicating positive regulation by ethylene, whereas Fc-ACS2 gene expression was induced by 1-MCP and inhibited by propylene indicating negative regulation by ethylene. The Fc-ACS3 mRNA showed high level accumulation in the auxin treated fruit. The inhibition of Fc-ACS3 gene by 1-MCP in oil treated and in ripe fruits suggests that auxin and ethylene modulate the expression of this gene by multi-responsive signal transduction pathway mechanisms. We further report that the olive oil-induced ethylene in figs involves the ACC-dependent pathway and that multiple ethylene regulatory pathways are involved during maturation and ripening in figs and each specific pathway depends on the inducer/stimulus.

Their predicted amino acid sequences exhibited similarities to ERFs from other plant species. Functional nuclear localization signal analyses of two Ps-ERF proteins (Ps-ERF1a and -1b) were carried out using confocal microscopy. Expression analyses of Ps-ERF mRNAs were studied in the two plum cultivars in order to determine the role of this gene family in fruit development and ripening. The seven Ps-ERFs displayed differential expression pattern and levels throughout the various stages of flower and fruit development. The diversity in Ps-ERFs accumulation was largely due to the differences in their responses to the levels of ethylene production. However, other plant hormones such as cytokinin and auxin, which accumulate strongly throughout the various developmental stages, also influence the Ps-ERFs expression. The effect of the plant hormones, gibberellin, cytokinin, auxin, and ethylene in regulating the different Ps-ERF transcripts was investigated.

Here, we report the role of a novel and uncharacterized Solarium melongena COP1 (SmCOP1) gene in tomato (Solarium lycopersicum) during fruit ripening. It was observed that SmCOP1 expressed in mature leaves and fruits, while the transcripts of SmCOP1 increased significantly with the onset of fruit ripening in tomato. To further understand the SmCOP1 function, an overexpression (OE) vector carrying SmCOP1 gene was constructed and transformed into tomato plants. The OE of SmCOP1 delays fruit ripening by about three to six days compared to the wild-type (WT) fruits. SmCOP1-OE fruits decreased while seedlings increased their ethylene production in comparison with the WT. Moreover, the ethylene biosynthesis genes (ACO1, ACO3, and ACS2) and ethylene inducible genes (E4 and E8), which participate in tomato fruit ripening, were suppressed. The carotenoid accumulation and expression level of carotenoid biosynthesis genes such as phytoene synthase 1 (PSY1), phytoene desaturase, (PDS), and zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS) were also reduced in OE fruits. Additionally, total chlorophyll contents were reduced, and expression of chlorophyll biosynthesis genes were significantly down-regulated in SmCOP1-OE lines. The SmCOP1-OE seedlings showed shorter hypocotyl lengths and were more sensitive to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) than were WT seedlings. In summary, SmCOP1-OE plays a pivotal role in the inhibition of tomato fruit ripening, reducing carotenoid contents and lowering ethylene production in fruits.","[Naeem, Muhammad] Chongqing Univ, Bioengn Coll, Campus B,174 Shapingba Main St, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China; [Muqarab, Rafia] Quaid I Azam Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan; [Waseem, Muhammad] Chongqing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Plant Hormones & Dev Regulat Chongqing, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,"Naeem, M (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Bioengn Coll, Campus B,174 Shapingba Main St, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,naeembbt@gmail.com; rafia_muqarab@yahoo.com; m.waseem.botanist@gmail.com,"WASEEM, MUHAMMAD/K-9284-2019","WASEEM, MUHAMMAD/0000-0001-7947-7722",,,50,2,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0176-1617,1618-1328,SEP,2019,240,,10.1016/j.jplph.2019.152997,Plant Sciences,JA3XL,WOS:000487762800010,31229781,,

Talma), Although it is accepted that the genotype and a number of physiological and environmental factors play a role in the development of the syndrome, the intimate mechanisms responsible for water-soaking remain unknown. We report here on an integrated study of the development of water-soaking in fruit. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, we have shown that water mobility increased in the diseased tissues. Alteration of the cell wall and the presence of large intercellular spaces were correlated with a severe depletion of cell wall calcium. Water-soaking developed during the late stages of fruit ripening, but no correlation was found with ethylene biosynthesis, Thus, fruits in which ethylene action was blocked by 1-methylcyclopropene remained sensitive to eater-soaking. Moreover, the expression of two genes encoding key enzymes in ethylene biosynthesis remained unchanged in response to water-soaking, The major changes observed concerned a protein implicated in calcium signalling processes, While the amount of total calmodulin, the ubiquitous calcium binding protein, was not modified, a particular calmodulin-binding protein (CaM-BP) was absent in water-soaked but not in sound mature tissues. This CaM-BP may be a marker or a determinant of this physiological disorder.","Univ Toulouse 3, Lab CNRS UPS UMR 5546, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; INRA, UMR 990, ENSAT, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; CSIC, CEBAS, E-30080 Murcia, Spain",,"Graziana, A (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse 3, Lab CNRS UPS UMR 5546, Pole Biotechnol Vegetale,24 Chemin Borde Rouge,BP, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",France,Europe,Global North,,"Olmos, Enrique/B-6235-2008","Olmos, Enrique/0000-0003-2392-8891",,,44,26,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0031-9317,,OCT,2000,110,2,10.1034/j.1399-3054.2000.110215.x,Plant Sciences,363HC,WOS:000089828700015,,,

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor is the largest TF gene family in plants that controls various biological and developmental aspects, but the actual roles of these genes have not been fully studied. Here, we performed a functional characterization of the bHLH gene SlbHLH22 in tomato. SlbHLH22 was fully expressed in tomato flowers, while a moderate expression level was also observed in fruits at different developmental stages. Overexpression of the SlbHLH22 gene revealed that it is highly involved in controlling flowering time, through the activation of the SlSFT or SlLFY genes, and promoting fruit ripening and improved carotenoid accumulation. The expression patterns of carotenoid-related genes (SlPYS1) were also upregulated in transgenic tomato fruits. In transgenic tomato fruit, we observed clear changes in colour from green to orange with enhanced expression of the SlbHLH22 gene. SlbHLH22 was upregulated under exogenous ACC, IAA, ABA, and ethephon. Overexpression of SlbHLH22 also promotes ethylene production. Moreover, ethylene biosynthesis and perception genes (SlACO3, SlACS1, SlACS2, SlACS4, SlACS1a, SlEIN1, SlEIN2, SlEIN3, SlEIN4, SlETR2, SlETR3, SlSAM3, and SlSAMS) were upregulated. Ripening-related genes (SlAP2a, SlCNR, SlNOR, SlMYB, and SlTAG) were consistent in their expression pattern in transgenic plants. Finally, our study provides evidence that tomato bHLH genes play an important role in flowering, fruit ripening, and development.","[Waseem, Muhammad; Li, Ning; Su, Deding; Chen, Jingxuan; Li, Zhengguo] Chongqing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China; [Waseem, Muhammad; Li, Ning; Su, Deding; Chen, Jingxuan; Li, Zhengguo] Key Lab Funct Gene & Regulat Technol Chongqing Mu, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,"Li, Z (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China.; Li, Z (corresponding author), Key Lab Funct Gene & Regulat Technol Chongqing Mu, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,m.waseem.botanist@gmail.com; ningli.li@outlook.com; su.deng@163.com; cjingxuan@yahoo.com; zhengguoli@cqu.edu.cn,"Li, Zhengguo/AAR-5191-2020; WASEEM, MUHAMMAD/K-9284-2019","WASEEM, MUHAMMAD/0000-0001-7947-7722",National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFD0400101]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31572175]; Committee of Science and Technology of Chongqing [cstc2014kjcxljrc0020],"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFD0400101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31572175), and the Committee of Science and Technology of Chongqing (cstc2014kjcxljrc0020).",77,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0032-0935,1432-2048,JUL,2019,250,1,10.1007/s00425-019-03157-8,Plant Sciences,IC6CX,WOS:000471058300013,30955097,Closed,Closed

The burst in ethylene production is the key event for the onset of ripening in climacteric fruits, including tomatoes. Therefore ethylene is held accountable for the tons of post-harvest losses due to over-ripening and subsequently resulting in fruit rotting. In the present investigation, delayed ripening tomatoes were generated by silencing three homologs of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS) gene during the course of ripening using RNAi technology. The chimeric RNAi-ACS construct designed to target ACS homologs, effectively repressed the ethylene production in tomato fruits. Fruits from such lines exhibited delayed ripening and extended shelf life for 45 days, with improved juice quality. The ethylene suppression brought about compositional changes in these fruits by enhancing polyamine (PA) levels. Further, decreased levels of ethylene in RNAi-ACS fruits has led to the altered levels of various ripening-specific transcripts, especially the up-regulation of PA biosynthesis and ascorbic acid (AsA) metabolism genes and down-regulation of cell wall hydrolyzing enzyme genes. These results suggest that the down-regulation of ACS homologs using RNAi can be an effective approach for obtaining delayed ripening with longer shelf life and an enhanced processing quality of tomato fruits. Also, the chimeric gene fusion can be used as an effective design for simultaneous silencing of more than one gene. These observations would be useful in better understanding of the ethylene and PA signaling during fruit ripening and molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of these two molecules in affecting fruit quality traits.

We investigated the effect of ethylene on cotyledon curling of Japanese radish sprouts. Curling was promoted by exogenous treatment with ethylene and repressed by treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene, an inhibitor of ethylene perception. Microscopic observation of ethylene-exposed curled cotyledons and normal cotyledons indicates that ethylene did not affect cell number but did inhibit transverse (lateral) cell growth on the abaxial side of the cotyledons, causing cotyledon curling through differential growth. Ethylene inhibition of cell growth on the abaxial side of leaves has not been reported before. We show a new mechanism responsible for curling.","[Kubo, Yusuke] Ibaraki Prefectural Namiki Secondary Sch, 4-5-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Kubo, Yusuke; Kinoshita, Toshinori] Nagoya Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Satoh, Shinobu; Suzuki, Haruka] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Kinoshita, Toshinori] Nagoya Univ, Inst Transformat Biomol WPI ITbM, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Nakajima, Nobuyoshi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050053, Japan",,"Nakajima, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050053, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,naka-320@nies.go.jp,"Kinoshita, Toshinori/C-2891-2012","Kinoshita, Toshinori/0000-0001-7621-1259",University of Tsukuba GFEST program; Global Science Campus from Japan Science and Technology Agency,"We thank Masanori Tamaoki and Motoyuki Ashikari for providing 1-MCP used in this work.

In some fruit species, there is a strong association between auxin concentrations and fruit ripening. We investigated the relationship between auxin concentrations and the onset of ethylene-related ripening in Malus x domestica (apples) at both the hormone and transcriptome levels. Methodology Transgenic apples suppressed for the SEPALLATA1/2 (SEP1/2) class of gene (MADS8/9) that showed severely reduced ripening were compared with untransformed control apples. In each apple type, free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentrations were measured during early ripening. The changes observed in auxin were assessed in light of global changes in gene expression. Principal results It was found that mature MADS8/9-suppressed apples had a higher concentration of free IAA. This was associated with increased expression of the auxin biosynthetic genes in the indole-3-acetamide pathway. Additionally, in the MADS8/9-suppressed apples, there was less expression of the GH3 auxin-conjugating enzymes. A number of genes involved in the auxin-regulated transcription (AUX/IAA and ARF classes of genes) were also observed to change in expression, suggesting a mechanism for signal transduction at the start of ripening. Conclusions The delay in ripening observed in MADS8/9-suppressed apples may be partly due to high auxin concentrations. We propose that, to achieve low auxin associated with fruit maturation, the auxin homeostasis is controlled in a two-pronged manner: (i) by the reduction in biosynthesis and (ii) by an increase in auxin conjugation. This is associated with the change in expression of auxin-signalling genes and the up-regulation of ripening-related genes.","[Schaffer, Robert J.; Ireland, Hilary S.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Schaffer, Robert J.; David, Karine M.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Ross, John J.; Ling, Toby J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",,"Schaffer, RJ (corresponding author), New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res, Private Bag 92169, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",New Zealand,Oceania,Global North,robert.schaffer@plantandfood.co.nz,"Ireland, Hilary/I-6314-2015; Schaffer, Robert J/D-1018-2011","Ireland, Hilary/0000-0001-5072-7206; Schaffer, Robert/0000-0003-1272-667X; David, Karine/0000-0002-3924-5078",New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation FRST [C06X0705]; Faculty Research Development Fund of the University of Auckland,"This work was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation FRST contract C06X0705; Pipfruit, a juicy future; and by the Faculty Research Development Fund of the University of Auckland.",37,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,2013,5,,10.1093/aobpla/pls047,Plant Sciences; Ecology,AJ2JI,WOS:000337481500002,23346344,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",

The Arabidopsis genome encodes nine ACS polypeptides that form eight functional (ACS2, ACS4-9, and ACS11) homodimers and one nonfunctional (ACS1) homodimer. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines were constructed expressing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter genes from the promoter of each of the gene family members to determine their patterns of expression during plant development. All genes, except ACS9, are expressed in 5-d-old etiolated or light-grown seedlings yielding distinct patterns of GUS staining. ACS9 expression is detected later in development. Unique and overlapping expression patterns were detected for all the family members in various organs of adult plants. ACS11 is uniquely expressed in the trichomes of sepals and ACS1 in the replum. Overlapping expression was observed in hypocotyl, roots, various parts of the flower (sepals, pedicle, style, etc.) and in the stigmatic and abscission zones of the silique. Exogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) enhances the constitutive expression of ACS2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11 in the root. Wounding of hypocotyl tissue inhibits the constitutive expression of ACS1 and ACS5 and induces the expression of ACS2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11. Inducers of ethylene production such as cold, heat, anaerobiosis, and W ions enhance or suppress the expression of various members of the gene family in the root of light-grown seedlings. Examination of GUS expression in transverse sections of cotyledons reveals that all ACS genes, except ACS9, are expressed in the epidermis cell layer, guard cells, and vascular tissue. Similar analysis with root tip tissue treated with IAA reveals unique and overlapping expression patterns in the various cell types of the lateral root cap, cell division, and cell expansion zones. IAA inducibility is gene-specific and cell type-dependent across the root tip zone. This limited comparative exploration of ACS gene family expression reveals constitutive spatial and temporal expression patterns of all gene family members throughout the growth period examined. The unique and overlapping gene activity pattern detected reveals a combinatorial code of spatio-temporal coexpression among the various gene family members during plant development. This raises the prospect that functional ACS heterodimers may be formed in planta.","Ctr Plant Gene Express, Albany, CA 94710 USA",,"Theologis, A (corresponding author), Ctr Plant Gene Express, Albany, CA 94710 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,theo@nature.berkeley.edu,,,,,72,269,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,OCT,2004,136,2,10.1104/pp.104.049999,Plant Sciences,862NG,WOS:000224497000010,15466221,"Green Published, Bronze",

In most previous studies in carnation, petal senescence was analyzed in cut flowers, and knowledge of petal senescence in intact flowers is limited. In this study, we compared changes in sugar level, ethylene production and expression of senescence-associated genes during petal senescence in cut and intact flowers using potted carnations (Dianthus caryophyllus L. cv California Mahalo). Flower longevity was significantly shorter in cut flowers than in intact flowers. Both cut and intact flowers showed inward rolling of petals and an increase in ethylene production at the end of their floral life; however, the timing of increase in ethylene production was clearly accelerated in cut flowers. Glucose and fructose levels in the petals of cut flowers rapidly decreased from the full-opening stage, while these levels remained relatively high in intact flowers. The accelerated induction of genes for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (DcACS1) and ACC oxidase (DcACO1) in cut flowers corresponded with ethylene production. The transcript level of DcEIL1/2, a homolog of EIN3, which is a key component in ethylene signaling, rapidly decreased in senescing petals of cut flowers, while it remained relatively high until the end of floral life in intact flowers. We isolated a homolog of autophagy-related gene 8 (DcATG8a), which is an essential gene for autophagy, and a gene for hexokinase (DcHXK1), which is known as a glucose sensor, from carnation flowers. Increasing transcript level of DcATG8a in senescing petals corresponded with ethylene production in both intact and cut flowers. The transcript level of DcHXK1 gradually decreased over time in both cut and intact flowers, but to a lesser extent in intact flowers. These results suggest that petal senescence in cut flowers is hastened by accelerated ethylene production, which is likely due to a rapid decrease in sugar content. Our data on hexokinase may also suggest the involvement of a sugar sensor in the regulation of petal senescence.","[Kondo, Mariko; Shibuya, Kenichi; Ichimura, Kazuo] NARO, Inst Vegetable & Floriculture Sci, Fujimoto 2-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050852, Japan; [Nakajima, Taku] Chiba Agr & Forestry Res Ctr, Midori Ku, Chiba 2660014, Japan; [Ichimura, Kazuo] Fukukaen Nursery & Bulb Co Ltd, Yokaichi 5121104, Japan",,"Shibuya, K (corresponding author), NARO, Inst Vegetable & Floriculture Sci, Fujimoto 2-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050852, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,shibuken@affrc.go.jp,,,"National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Japan","This work was supported by grants from the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Japan.",39,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-4238,1879-1018,15-Oct,2020,272,,10.1016/j.scienta.2020.109564,Horticulture,MT7HY,WOS:000555142800056,,,

Histological analysis of wounded fruits of the climacteric netted variety Krimka, and of two smooth melon varieties: the climacteric Momordica and the non-climacteric Tamdew, indicated that smooth melon varieties can undergo netting when their rind is fissured. Furthermore, the results implied that the climacteric character is not essential for net-tissue development, even though most netted varieties are climacteric. The involvement of ethylene in net-like periderm development was studied by analyzing the expression pattern of the ethylene-biosynthesis genes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 1 and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase 1 following wounding and during periderm development, and by applying the ethylene-generating chemical, Ethrel, as a lanolin paste, on the fresh cuts.

These loci interact to produce three different sexual phenotypes: gynoecious (M-F-), monoecious (M-ff), and andromonoecious (mmff). Gynoecious cucumber plants produce more ethylene than do monoecious plants, We found that the levels of ethylene production and the accumulation of CS-ACS2 mRNA in andromonoecious cucumber plants did not differ from those in monoecious plants and were lower than the levels measured in gynoecious plants, Ethylene inhibited stamen development in gynoecious cucumbers but not in andromonoecious ones. Furthermore, ethylene caused substantial increases in the accumulation of CS-ETR2, CS-ERS, and CS-ACS2 mRNA in monoecious and gynoecious cucumber plants, but not in andromonoecious one. In addition, the inhibitory effect of ethylene on hypocotyl elongation in andromonoecious cucumber plants was less than that in monoecious and gynoecious plants. These results suggest that ethylene responses in andromonoecious cucumber plants are reduced from those in monoecious and gynoecious plants. This is the first evidence that ethylene signals may influence the product of the M locus and thus inhibit stamen development in cucumber. The andromonoecious line provides novel material for studying the function of the M locus during sex determination in flowering cucumbers.","Tohoku Univ, Inst Genet Ecol, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; Tohoku Seed Co Ltd, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3213232, Japan",,"Takahashi, H (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Inst Genet Ecol, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,,"Fujii, Nobuharu/AAH-7402-2019",,,,38,115,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,,JUN,2001,42,6,10.1093/pcp/pce076,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,443LH,WOS:000169342300008,11427680,Bronze,

Most informative are 'whole genome' arrays, where all gene expression products of a single species or variety are represented. Such arrays are now available for a limited number of model species. However, for other, less well-documented species other routes are still necessary to obtain informative arrays. This includes the use of cDNA libraries. To enhance the amount of information that can be obtained from cDNA libraries, redundancy needs to be minimised, and the number of cDNAs relevant for the conditions of interest needs to be increased. Here, we used representational difference analysis (RDA), a mRNA subtraction procedure, as a tool. to enhance the efficiency of cDNA libraries to be used to generate microarrays. Tomato was chosen as a model system for a less well-documented species. cDNA libraries for two distinct physiological conditions of tomato fruits, red and green, were made. The libraries were characterized by sequencing and hybridisation analysis. The RDA procedure was shown to be effective in selecting for genes of relevance for the physiological, conditions under investigation, and against constitutively expressed genes. At the same time, redundancy was reduced, but complete normalisation was not obtained, and subsequent sequence analysis will be required to obtain non-redundant arrays. Further, known and putative ripening-related cDNAs were identified in hybridisation experiments on the basis of RNA populations as isolated from the green and red stage of ripening.

Work in model species has shown that following the detection of ethylene, the ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) transcription factor is stabilized, leading to an increase in transcript accumulation of ethylene-responsive genes, such as POLYGALACTURONASE1 (PG1). In the absence of ethylene, the EIN3 BINDING F-box (EBF) proteins rapidly degrade EIN3 via the ubiquitination/SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-Box) proteasome pathway. In this study, we aim to identify and characterize the apple EBF genes, and test their activity against apple EIN3-like proteins (EILs). Methodology The apple genome sequence was mined for EBF-like genes. The expression of EBF-like genes was measured during fruit development. Using a transient assay in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, the activity of three apple EILs was tested against the PG1 promoter, with and without ethylene and EBF1. Principal results Four EBF-like genes in apple were identified and grouped into two sub-clades. Sub-clade I genes had constant expression over fruit development while sub-clade II genes increased in expression at ripening. EBF1 was shown to reduce the transactivation of the apple PG1 promoter by the EIL1, EIL2 and EIL3 transcription factors in the presence of ethylene. Conclusions The apple EBF1 gene identified here is likely to be a functionally conserved EBF orthologue, modulating EIL activity in apples. The activity of EBF1 suggests that it is not specific to a single EIL, instead acting as a global regulator of apple EIL transcription factors.","[Tacken, Emma J.; Ireland, Hilary S.; Wang, Yen-Yi; Schaffer, Robert J.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Tacken, Emma J.; Putterill, Jo; Schaffer, Robert J.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",,"Schaffer, RJ (corresponding author), New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res, Private Bag 92169, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",New Zealand,Oceania,Global North,robert.schaffer@plantandfood.co.nz,"Ireland, Hilary/I-6314-2015; Schaffer, Robert J/D-1018-2011; Tacken, Emma/I-1725-2013","Ireland, Hilary/0000-0001-5072-7206; Tacken, Emma/0000-0003-2066-0842; Schaffer, Robert/0000-0003-1272-667X","Agriculture and Marketing Research and Development Trust of New Zealand (AgMardt); University of Auckland, New Zealand; Foundation of Science and Research Technology (FRST) [C06X0705]","This work was funded by The Agriculture and Marketing Research and Development Trust of New Zealand (AgMardt), The University of Auckland, New Zealand and the Foundation of Science and Research Technology (FRST) contract C06X0705; Pipfruit, a juicy future.",37,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,2012,,,10.1093/aobpla/pls034,Plant Sciences; Ecology,229KZ,WOS:000325264700014,23585922,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",

No significant difference in longevity was observed between the attached and detached petals when held in distilled water, and both showed the inward rolling typical of senescing flowers. Treatment with silver thiosulfate complex (STS), an ethylene inhibitor, similarly delayed senescence of attached and detached petals. Climacteric-like increases in ethylene production of petals and gynoecium started on the same day, with similar bursts in attached and detached petals. Transcript levels of DcACS1 and DcACO1 were very low at harvest and increased similarly during senescence in both petal groups. Removal of the gynoecium did not significantly delay wilting of attached petals. In flowers with the gynoecium removed, the petals produced most of the ethylene while production by the other floral organs was very low, suggesting that wound-induced ethylene is not the reason for the ineffectiveness of gynoecium-removal in inhibiting flower senescence.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing showed that ERF4 binds to the promoter ofERF3, which is involved in regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. The EAR mutation in ERF4 results in reduced repression ofERF3expression, which is turn promotes ethylene production and loss of fruit firmness. ERF4 acts as a transcriptional repressor whose activity is modulated by a TOPLESS co-repressor 4 (TPL4)-binding EAR repression motif. Biolayer interferometry analysis showed that the mutation in the EAR motif causes a reduction in the interaction with TPL4. Suppression ofERF4orTPL4promoted fruit ripening and ethylene production.

Abstract The molecular mechanisms regulating dormancy release in grapevine buds are as yet unclear. It has been hypothesized that its core involves perturbation of respiration which induces an interplay between ethylene and ABA metabolism that removes repression and allows regrowth. Roles for hypoxia and ABA metabolism in this process have been previously supported. The potential involvement of ethylene biosynthesis in regulation of dormancy release, which has received little attention so far, is now explored. Our results indicate that (1) ethylene biosynthesis is induced by hydrogen cyanamide (HC) and azide (AZ), known artificial stimuli of dormancy release, (2) inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and signalling antagonize dormancy release by HC/AZ treatments, (3) ethylene application induces dormancy release, (4) there are two sets of bud-expressed ethylene biosynthesis genes which are differentially regulated, (5) only one set is transiently upregulated by HC/AZ and during the natural dormancy cycle, concomitant with changes in ethylene levels, and (6) levels of ACC oxidase transcripts and ethylene sharply decrease during natural dormancy release, whereas ACC accumulates. Given these results, we propose that transient increases in ethylene biosynthesis prior to dormancy release, achieved primarily by regulation of transcription of specific ACC oxidase genes, play a role in activation of dormancy release.","[Shi, Zhaowan; Halaly-Basha, Tamar; Zheng, Chuanlin; Weissberg, Mira; Ophir, Ron; Or, Etti] Agr Res Org, Inst Plant Sci, Dept Fruit Tree Sci, Volcani Ctr, IL-7528809 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel; [Shi, Zhaowan; Pang, Xuequn] South China Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Galbraith, David W.] Univ Arizona, Sch Plant Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Galbraith, David W.] Univ Arizona, Inst Bio5, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Or, E (corresponding author), Agr Res Org, Inst Plant Sci, Dept Fruit Tree Sci, Volcani Ctr, IL-7528809 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.",Israel,Middle east,Global North,vhettior@agri.gov.il,"Galbraith, David/AAG-8891-2021",,United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD)US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [IS-4639-13]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council,"This research was supported by the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD Grant No. IS-4639-13 to EO, DG, and RO).

Ethylene is known to play a critical role in floral sex determination of cucurbit species. In contrast to its feminizing effect in cucumber and melon, in watermelon ethylene promotes male flower development. In cucumber, the rate-limiting enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS), regulates unisexual flower development. To investigate the role of ethylene in flower development, we isolated four genomic sequences of ACS from watermelon (CitACS1-4). Both CitACS1 and CitACS3 are expressed in floral tissue. CitACS1 is also expressed in vegetative tissue and it may be involved in cell growth processes. Expression of CitACS1 is up-regulated by exogenous treatment with auxin, gibberellin or ACC, the immediate precursor of ethylene. No discernible differential floral sex-dependent expression pattern was observed for this gene. The CitACS3 gene is expressed in open flowers and in young staminate floral buds (male or hermaphrodite), but not in female flowers. CitACS3 is also up-regulated by ACC, and is likely to be involved in ethylene-regulated anther development. The expression of CitACS2 was not detected in vegetative or reproductive organs but was up-regulated by auxin. CitACS4 transcript was not detected under our experimental conditions. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence tagged site (STS) marker analyses of the CitACS genes showed polymorphism among and within the different Citrullus groups, including watermelon cultivars, Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus, the central subspecies Citrullus lanatus var. citroides, and the desert species Citrullus colocynthis (L).","[Salman-Minkov, Ayelet; Trebitsh, Tova] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Levi, Amnon] ARS, USDA, US Veg Lab, Charleston, SC 29414 USA; [Wolf, Shmuel] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",,"Trebitsh, T (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",Israel,Middle east,Global North,trebitsh@bgu.ac.il,,,,,51,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,1471-9053,MAY,2008,49,5,10.1093/pcp/pcn045,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,305JD,WOS:000256173400006,18367517,Bronze,

In this study, we aimed to identify and analyze the acs genes in the genome of V. volvacea. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify differences between the acs sequences of V. volvacea and homolog gene sequences of plants. Furthermore, ethylene production and acs expression in V. volvacea during storage were measured before and after ethephon and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatments. The results showed that there are four acs genes in the genome of V. volvacea, and the phylogenetic tree revealed that the proteins encoded by these genes had high homology to the ACS proteins in plants, with some differences. A conserved motif was found in these ACS proteins. Ethephon accelerated endogenous ethylene production and upregulated acs expression in V. volvacea, whereas 1-MCP inhibited endogenous ethylene production and downregulated acs expression in V. volvacea. Our study provides valuable data to further investigate the roles of acs in the mechanisms of senescence of V. volvacea. Further, acs could be used to develop molecular markers enabling screening and selective breeding of V. volvacea strains with slowed senescence, prolonging the shelf life of the product.","[Chen, Juanqin; Chen, Tianci; Qiu, Mingmeng; Li, Ling; Zhong, Qiangui; Wei, Qi; Jiang, Yuji; Chen, Bingzhi] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Food Sci, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China; [Chen, Juanqin; Chen, Tianci; Qiu, Mingmeng; Li, Ling; Zhong, Qiangui; Wei, Qi; Deng, Youjin; Xie, Baogui; Jiang, Yuji; Chen, Bingzhi] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Mycol Res Ctr, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, YJ; Chen, BZ (corresponding author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Food Sci, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,jyj1209@163.com; cbz_2006@163.com,,"Chen, Bingzhi/0000-0003-0254-7475","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31801920]; China Agriculture Research System [CARS24]; National Modern Agriculture Technology System of Edible Fungi Industry [KMD16001A]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2020J01557]; Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Science and Technology Innovation Fund Project [CXZX2017409, CXZX2017410]; Education and Scientific Research Projects of Young and Middleaged Teachers in Fujian Province [JT180115]","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31801920), China Agriculture Research System (CARS24), National Modern Agriculture Technology System of Edible Fungi Industry (KMD16001A), Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2020J01557), Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Science and Technology Innovation Fund Project (CXZX2017409, CXZX2017410) and Education and Scientific Research Projects of Young and Middleaged Teachers in Fujian Province (JT180115).",47,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-4238,1879-1018,27-Feb,2021,278,,10.1016/j.scienta.2020.109848,Horticulture,PI0IT,WOS:000600785100013,,,

However, the molecular regulation of ethylene biosynthesis during wood formation is poorly understood. We have characterised an abundant 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase gene (PttACO1 ) in the wood-forming tissues of Populus tremula (L.) x P. tremuloides (Michx). PttACO1 is primarily expressed in developing secondary xylem, and is specifically upregulated during secondary wall formation. Nevertheless, according to GC-MS analysis combined with tangential cryosectioning, the distribution of ACC was found to be fairly uniform across the cambial-region tissues. Gravitational stimulation, which causes tension wood to form on the upper side of the stem, resulted in a strong induction of PttACO1 expression and ACC oxidase activity in the tension wood-forming tissues. The ACC levels increased in parallel to the PttACO1 expression. However, the increase on the upper (tension wood) side was only minor, whereas large amounts of both ACC and its hydrolysable conjugates accumulated on the lower (opposite) side of the stem. This suggests that the relatively low level of ACC on the tension wood side is a result of its conversion to ethylene by the highly upregulated PttACO1, and the concurrent accumulation of ACC on the opposite side of the wood is because of the low PttACO1 levels. We conclude that PttACO1 and ACC oxidase activity, but not ACC availability, are important in the control of the asymmetric ethylene production within the poplar stem when tension wood is induced by gravitational stimulation.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Umea Plant Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",,"Sundberg, B (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Umea Plant Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Sweden,Europe,Global North,Bjorm.Sundberg@genfys.slu.se,,"Moritz, Thomas/0000-0002-4258-3190",,,61,108,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-7412,1365-313X,MAY,2003,34,3,10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01727.x,Plant Sciences,671FT,WOS:000182455200008,12713540,Closed,Closed

Recently, it was demonstrated that ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, plays a significant role in tomato pollen heat-tolerance. It is not clear, however, whether, or to what extent, pollen grains are dependent on the capacity of the surrounding anther tissues for ethylene synthesis and signaling, or can synthesize this hormone and possess an active signaling pathway. The aim of this work was (1) to investigate if isolated, maturing and mature, tomato pollen grains have the capacity for ethylene production, (2) to find out whether pollen grains possess an active ethylene-biosynthesis and -signaling pathway and characterize the respective tomato pollen components at the transcript level, (3) to look into the effect of short-term HS conditions. Results from accumulation studies showed that pollen, anthers, and flowers produced ethylene and HS affected differentially ethylene production by (rehydrated) mature pollen, compared to anthers and flowers, causing elevated ethylene levels. Furthermore, several ethylene synthesis genes were expressed, with SlACS3 and SlACS11 standing out as highly HS-induced genes of the pollen ethylene biosynthesis pathway. Specific components of the ethylene-signaling pathway as well as several ethylene-responsive factors were expressed in pollen, with SlETR3 (ethylene receptor; named also NR, for never ripe) and SlCTR2 (constitutive triple response2) being HS responsive. This work shows that tomato pollen grains have the capacity for ethylene production, possessing active ethylene-biosynthesis and -signaling pathways, highlighting specific pollen components that serve as a valuable resource for future research on the role of ethylene in pollen thermotolerance.","[Jegadeesan, Sridharan; Beery, Avital; Altahan, Leviah; Pressman, Etan; Firon, Nurit] Agr Res Org, Dept Vegetable Res, Inst Plant Sci, Volcani Ctr, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel; [Meir, Shimon] Agr Res Org, Postharvest Sci Fresh Produce Postharvest & Food, Volcani Ctr, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel; [Jegadeesan, Sridharan] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Rehovot, Israel",,"Firon, N (corresponding author), Agr Res Org, Dept Vegetable Res, Inst Plant Sci, Volcani Ctr, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel.",Israel,Middle east,Global North,vcfiron@volcani.agri.gov.il,"S., Jegadeesan/B-6417-2018","S., Jegadeesan/0000-0002-6457-4906; , Nurit/0000-0002-1096-1425; Jegadeesan, Sridharan/0000-0001-6233-6130","Chief Scientist of The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Israel [2610970] Funding Source: Medline; European Marie-Curie International training network [289220] Funding Source: Medline",,57,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2194-7953,2194-7961,DEC,2018,31,4,10.1007/s00497-018-0339-0,Plant Sciences; Reproductive Biology,GZ8WM,WOS:000449775900003,29948007,,

The effects of these on rice growth under water deficit conditions were evaluated. The bacterial inoculations reduced ethylene synthesis, leading to a reduction in membrane destruction and the chlorophyll content of rice. Furthermore, the bacterial inoculations improved the leaf relative water content, survival, recovery rates, and improved the crop yield in field conditions. Therefore, the water deficit tolerance of rice was improved by controlling ethylene biosynthesis by improving ACC deaminase activity with endophytic SUTN9-2.

The expression profiles of genes encoding ABA route components and the ACC oxidase isozymes were investigated in Populus tremula during the early and moderate stages of autumn leaf senescence. The targets of interest were Ptre-HAB1-like genes (Ptre-HAB1, Ptre-HAB3a and Ptre-HAB3b), the subclass 3 of Ptre-SnRK2s genes (Ptre-SnRK2.6a, Ptre-SnRK2.6b and Ptre-SnRK2.6b) and Ptre-RbohD1, Ptre-RbohF1, and Ptre-RbohF2 genes encoding the poplar components, which are counterparts of the ABA route key regulators or the counterparts of its secondary messengers, such as Homology to ABA-insensitive 1 (HAB1), Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinases 2 (SnRK2s) or Respiratory burst oxidase D and Respiratory burst oxidase F (RbohD and RbohF, respectively) in Arabidopsis, and Ptre-ACO3, Ptre-ACO5, and Ptre-ACO6 genes encoding ACC oxidase isozymes involved in ethylene biosynthesis. The fold change in their expression levels enabled to distinguish the distinct expression patterns for the following pairs of genes: Ptre-HAB3a and Ptre-SnRK2.6a, Ptre-HAB3b and Ptre-SnRK2.2, and Ptre-HAB1 and Ptre-SnRK2.6b, where each pair involves the genes encoding the negative and positive regulators of ABA route, respectively. Among the investigated genes, the fold change of expression was the highest for Ptre-ACO3, Ptre-ACO6, and Ptre-SnRK2.6b genes during both the studied stages, and additionally for Ptre-HAB1 and Ptre-RbohD1 genes during the moderate stage. In contrast, the Ptre-RbohF1 and Ptre-RbohF2 genes exhibited only the transient upregulation at the early stage of senescence. In an in vitro study, the ability of protein kinases Ptre-SnRK2.6a and Ptre-SnRK2.6b to phosphorylate the N-terminal regions of Ptre-RbohD1 and Ptre-RbohF2 was studied; the activity of Ptre-SnRK2.6b against the studied Ptre-Rbohs was noticeably lower than that exhibited by Ptre-SnRK2.6a. It seems that despite the high similarity of their polypeptides, Ptre-SnRK2.6a and Ptre-SnRK2.6b may play different biological roles; nonetheless, it requires in vivo confirmation. Surprisingly, the highest protein kinase activity against the Ptre-Rbohs was detected in the heterologous reaction with AT-SnRK2.6/OST1 which suggests that the discussed interactions are evolutionary conserved.","[Jakubowicz, Malgorzata] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Dept Genome Biol, Uniwersytetu Poznanskiego 6, Poznan 61614, Poland; [Nowak, Witold; Galganski, Lukasz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Mol Biol Tech Lab, Uniwersytetu Poznanskiego 6, Poznan 61614, Poland; [Babula-Skowronska, Danuta] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Plant Genet, Dept Environm Stress Biol, Strzeszynska 34, Poznan 60479, Poland; [Kubiak, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Food Sci & Nutr, Dept Biotechnol & Food Microbiol, Wojska Polskiego 48, Poznan 60627, Poland",,"Jakubowicz, M (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Dept Genome Biol, Uniwersytetu Poznanskiego 6, Poznan 61614, Poland.",Poland,Europe,Global North,goja@amu.edu.pl,"Babula-Skowronska, Danuta/ABC-3243-2020; Kubiak, Piotr/U-5838-2019","Kubiak, Piotr/0000-0001-8851-912X; Galganski, Lukasz/0000-0002-1064-426X","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [01/KNOW2/2014]; National Science Center, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [UMO-2011/01/D/NZ3/02068, UMO-2015/19/D/NZ3/00479]","This work was supported by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grant 01/KNOW2/2014 to KNOW RNA Research Centre in Poznan, and by the National Science Center, Poland (UMO-2011/01/D/NZ3/02068 to Lukasz Galganski and UMO-2015/19/D/NZ3/00479).",116,2,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0176-1617,1618-1328,MAY,2020,248,,10.1016/j.jplph.2020.153143,Plant Sciences,LK1XA,WOS:000530650800006,32126452,hybrid,

Lateral root (LR) induction and extension in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) has been observed to be governed by a probable crosstalk between NO and ethylene biosynthesizing enzyme-ACC oxidase. NaCl (120mM) stress not only lowers LR induction but also reduces their extension growth. Quenching of endogenous NO by raising seedlings in presence of 40 mu M hemoglobin in the growth medium does not affect LR induction but lowers their extension growth. NaCl stress and NO depletion have additive effects on the enhancement of ACC oxidase activity, leading to enhanced ethylene biosynthesis. Role of NO has been further confirmed by raising sunflower seedlings in the presence of 20-60 mu M of two NO donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA). LR extension growth was higher with DETA than SNP as NO donor at 40 mu M. Iron-deficiency also promoted LR proliferation. It also significantly lowered ACC oxidase activity in the seedling roots in response to salt stress. Based on the present findings it is proposed that salt stress-mediated LR proliferation is regulated by NO through its binding with ACC oxidase (an iron-containing enzyme). This results in the formation of a stable ternary complex (ACC-ACC oxidase-NO) which leads to the reduction in ethylene biosynthesis. Lesser availability of ethylene consequently brings about enhanced LR formation.","[Singh, Neha; Bhatla, Sathish C.] Univ Delhi, Dept Bot, Lab Plant Physiol & Biochem, Delhi, India",,"Singh, N; Bhatla, SC (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Dept Bot, Lab Plant Physiol & Biochem, Delhi, India.",India,Asia,Global South,singh.neha.du@gmail.com; bhatlasc@gmail.com,,,Indo-Belarus Joint Project [DST/INT/BLR/P-21/2016],This work was supported by the Indo-Belarus Joint Project [DST/INT/BLR/P-21/2016].,,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1559-2316,1559-2324,,2018,13,5,10.1080/15592324.2018.1473683,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,29939832,"Green Published, Bronze",

Here we reveal that loss of function of CKRC3 and NBC-1, the auxiliary subunit (Naa25) and catalytic subunit (Naa20) of Arabidopsis NatB, respectively, led to defects in skotomorphogenesis and triple responses of ethylene. Proteome profiling and WB test revealed that the 1-amincyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO, catalyzing the last step of ethylene biosynthesis pathway) activity was significantly down-regulated in natb mutants, leading to reduced endogenous ethylene content. The defective phenotypes could be fully rescued by application of exogenous ethylene, but less by its precursor ACC. The present results reveal a previously unknown regulation mechanism at the co-translational protein level for ethylene homeostasis, in which the NatB-mediated NTA of ACOs render them an intracellular stability to maintain ethylene homeostasis for normal growth and responses.","[Liu, Hai-qing; Zou, Ya-jie; Li, Xiao-feng; Wu, Lei; Guo, Guang-qin] Lanzhou Univ, Inst Cell Biol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hai-qing; Zou, Ya-jie; Li, Xiao-feng; Wu, Lei; Guo, Guang-qin] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, MOE Key Lab Cell Act & Stress Adaptat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",,"Guo, GQ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Inst Cell Biol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.; Guo, GQ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, MOE Key Lab Cell Act & Stress Adaptat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,gqguo@lzu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [3167080163, 32070721]; Open Project of NMPA Key Laboratory for Quality Control of TCM (NMPA Key Laboratory for Quality Control of TCM [2020GSMPA-KL02]","This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 3167080163 & No. 32070721); Open Project of NMPA Key Laboratory for Quality Control of TCM (NMPA Key Laboratory for Quality Control of TCM, Grant No. 2020GSMPA-KL02).",45,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2229,,3-Jul,2021,21,1,10.1186/s12870-021-03090-7,Plant Sciences,TH5DX,WOS:000672111500003,34217224,"gold, Green Published",Gold

In climacteric pears, where ethylene production was strongly inhibited by 1-MCP, a range of applied CO2 partial pressures was able to inhibit ethylene production further, to an extent similar to untreated pears. In the case of pears that had been stored for a period of 25 weeks, CO2 only had a clear effect after 1-MCP pretreatment. Respiration measurements showed that the effect of CO2 on ethylene production did not operate via an effect on respiration. Ethylene production models based on measurements of whole pears were used to study CO2 effects.

It is difficult to handle because they are scars easily and easy to decay. It is generally acknowledged that modified atmospheres with elevated CO2 inhibits fruit ripening by reduces ethylene biosynthesis. This study was to investigate the affect of high concentration CO2 treatment on ethylene biosynthesis, ACO and softening-related enzymatic activity. Peaches were treated with high CO2 (90 pKa) at the time of sealing in the plastic chambers and then the chambers were ventilated after 3 and 12 h. Fruits treated with 90 kPa CO2 for 3 or 12 h exhibited a significant delay in firmness when compared to control fruits. In addition to fruit softening inhibition, the decay rate was also inhibited by CO2 treatment. Four days after storage at room temperature, CO2 untreated peaches had decay rate of 14%, whereas the decay rate was 6% and 3.5% in fruits treated with 90 kPa CO2 for 3 and 12 h. The ACO was inhibited by CO2 and the inhibition was enhanced with higher CO2 exposure time. Also High CO2 treatment inhibited the activities of softening-related enzyme such as PG, beta-Galactosidase, PEL promoted by ethylene biosynthesis in peaches. These results indicate that increasing levels of CO2 inhibit ethylene biosynthesis by reducing the ACO activity of peach fruits. Results suggest that the effect of CO2 on ethylene production in 'Mihong' peach fruit depended on exposure time and CO2 level. Also a short-term treatment with a high concentration of CO2 may be used to reduce ethylene biosynthesis, which may be induced after postharvest of fruit.","[Chang, Eun-Ha; Lee, Jin-Su; Kim, Ji-Gang] Natl Inst Hort & Herbal Sci, Rural Dev Adm, Postharvest Res Div, Wonju 55365, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea",,"Chang, EH (corresponding author), Natl Inst Hort & Herbal Sci, Rural Dev Adm, Postharvest Res Div, Wonju 55365, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.",South Korea,Asia,Global North,cleo77@korea.kr,,"Chang, Eun Ha/0000-0002-5647-8842","Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science & Technology Development, RDA, Republic of Korea [PJ010138012016]","This study was carried out with the support of Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science & Technology Development (Project No. PJ010138012016), RDA, Republic of Korea.",55,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-4238,1879-1018,18-Nov,2017,225,,10.1016/j.scienta.2017.07.038,Horticulture,FJ3CC,WOS:000412606900052,,,

In the climacteric tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit, ethylene plays a key role in fruit ripening and softening. We characterized two related proteins with contrasting impact on ethylene production, ACC oxidase 1 (SIACO1) and SIE8. We found SIACO1 and SIE8 to be highly expressed during fruit ripening. To identify loss-of-function alleles, we analysed the tomato genetic diversity but we did not find any natural mutations impairing the function of these proteins. We also found the two loci evolving under purifying selection. To engineer hypomorphic alleles, we used TILLING (target-induced local lesions in genomes) to screen a tomato ethylmethane sulfonate-mutagenized population. We found 13 mutants that we phenotyped for ethylene production, shelf-life, firmness, conductivity, and soluble solid content in tomato fruits. The data demonstrated that slaco1-1 and slaco1-2 alleles could be used to improve fruit shelf-life, and that sle8-1 and sle8-2 alleles could be used to accelerate ripening. This study highlights further the importance of SIACO1 and SIE8 in ethylene production in tomato fruit and how they might be used for post-harvest fruit preservation or speeding up fruit maturation.","[Brisou, Gwilherm; Piquerez, Sophie J.

Yet, little information is available about the role of ethylene during paradormancy release in underground adventitious buds of leafy spurge. In this study, we examined changes in ethylene evolution and the ethylene biosynthetic enzyme ACC oxidase following paradormancy release (growth induction). Our results did not show an obvious increase in ethylene during bud growth. However, when buds were incubated with 1 mM ACC, ethylene levels were higher in growing than non-growing buds, suggesting that the levels of ACC oxidase increased in growing buds. Real-time qPCR indicated that the transcript of a Euphorbia esula ACC oxidase (Ee-ACO) increased up to threefold following growth induction. In addition, a 2.5- to 4-fold increase in ACO activity was observed 4 days after decapitation, and the Ee-ACO accounted for 40 % of the total ACO activity. Immunoblot analyses identified a 36-kD Ee-ACO protein that increased in expression during bud growth. This protein was highly expressed in leaves, moderately expressed in crown buds, stems and meristems, and weakly expressed in roots and flowers. Immunolocalization of Ee-ACO on growing bud sections revealed strong labeling of the nucleus and cytoplasm in cells at the shoot apical meristem and leaf primordia. An exception to this pattern occurred in cells undergoing mitosis, where labeling of Ee-ACO was negligible. Taken together, our results indicated an increase in the levels of Ee-ACO during paradormancy release of leafy spurge that was not correlated with an increase in ethylene synthesis.","[Chao, Wun S.; Suttle, Jeffrey C.] ARS, USDA, Fargo, ND 58102 USA; [Serpe, Marcelo] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Jia, Ying] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Natl Nat Toxins Res Ctr, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA",,"Chao, WS (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, Fargo, ND 58102 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,wun.chao@ars.usda.gov,,,,,47,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0032-0935,,JUL,2013,238,1,10.1007/s00425-013-1887-z,Plant Sciences,171WX,WOS:000320961900014,23625016,Closed,Closed

Here, we analysed ethylene homeostasis and function during Z. elegans TE differentiation using biochemical, molecular and pharmacological methods. Ethylene evolution was confined to specific stages of TE differentiation. It was found to peak at the time of TE maturation and to correlate with the activity of the ethylene biosynthetic 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase. The ethylene precursor ACC was exported and accumulated to high concentrations in the extracellular medium, which also displayed a high capacity to convert ACC into ethylene. The effects of adding inhibitors of the ethylene biosynthetic ACC synthase and ACC oxidase enzymes to the TE cultures demonstrated for the first time strict dependence of TE differentiation on ethylene biosynthesis and a stimulatory effect of ethylene on the rate of TE differentiation. In a whole-plant context, our results suggest that ethylene synthesis occurs in the apoplast of the xylem elements and that ethylene participates, in a paracrine manner, in the control of the cambial stem cell pool size during secondary xylem formation.","[Pesquet, Edouard; Tuominen, Hannele] Umea Univ, Dept Plant Physiol, UPSC, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",,"Tuominen, H (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Plant Physiol, UPSC, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",Sweden,Europe,Global North,hannele.tuominen@plantphys.umu.se,"Tuominen, Hannele/E-7263-2013; Tuominen, Hannele/D-9563-2014; Pesquet, Edouard/K-5627-2017","Tuominen, Hannele/0000-0002-4949-3702; Tuominen, Hannele/0000-0002-4949-3702; Pesquet, Edouard/0000-0002-6959-3284",Swedish Research Council Formas through the FuncFiber Centre of Excellence in Wood Science; Carl Trygger Foundation; Kempe Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the Swedish Research Council Formas (through the Research Programme on Wood Material Science and the FuncFiber Centre of Excellence in Wood Science), the Carl Trygger Foundation and the Kempe Foundation for providing financial support for this study.

In cucumber and melon, ethylene promotes carpel development and arrests stamen development. Five sex-determination genes have been identified, including four encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis, and a transcription factor gene CmWIP1 that corresponds to the Mendelian locus gynoecious in melon and is a negative regulator of femaleness. ACC oxidase (ACO) converts ACC into ethylene; however, it remains elusive which ACO gene in the cucumber genome is critical for sex determination and how CmWIP1 represses development of female flowers. In this study, we discovered that mutation in an ACO gene, CsACO2, confers androecy in cucumber that bears only male flowers. The mutation disrupts the enzymatic activity of CsACO2, resulting in 50% less ethylene emission from shoot tips. CsACO2 was expressed in the carpel primordia and its expression overlapped with that of CsACS11 in female flowers at key stages for sex determination, presumably providing sufficient ethylene required for proper CsACS2 expression. CmACO3, the ortholog of CsACO2, showed a similar expression pattern in the carpel region, suggesting a conserved function of CsACO2/CmACO3. We demonstrated that CsWIP1, the ortholog of CmWIP1, could directly bind the promoter of CsACO2 and repress its expression. Taken together, we propose a presumably conserved regulatory module consisting of WIP1 transcription factor and ACO controls unisexual flower development in cucumber and melon.","[Chen, Huiming; Cui, Qingzhi] Hunan Acad Agr Sci, Hunan Vegetable Res Inst, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jinjing; Li, Shuai; Zhang, Huimin; Wang, Huaisong; Lin, Tao; Gao, Dongli; Wang, Shenhao; Zhang, Zhonghua; Huang, Sanwen] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Biol & Genet Improvement Hort Crops, Sino Dutch Joint Lab Hort Genom, Minist Agr,Inst Vegetables & Flowers, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Huimin; Lin, Tao; Gao, Dongli; Huang, Sanwen] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Genom Inst Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518120, Peoples R China; [Xin, Fengjiao] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Prod Proc, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Xia; Wang, Donghui; Xu, Zhihong] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",,"Huang, SW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Biol & Genet Improvement Hort Crops, Sino Dutch Joint Lab Hort Genom, Minist Agr,Inst Vegetables & Flowers, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.; Huang, SW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Genom Inst Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518120, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,huangsanwen@caas.cn,"Li, Shuai/ABD-5132-2021; Huang, Sanwen/ABE-9053-2020","Li, Shuai/0000-0002-9574-9609; Huang, Sanwen/0000-0002-8547-5309","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31225025, 31471871, 31530066]; National Program on Key Basic Research Projects in China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB113900]; Science and Technology Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS-ASTIP-IVFCAAS)","This work was supported by funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31225025 to S.H., 31471871 to H.C., 31530066 to S.H.), the National Program on Key Basic Research Projects in China (the 973 Program; 2012CB113900), and the Science and Technology Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS-ASTIP-IVFCAAS).",42,56,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",1674-2052,1752-9867,6-Sep,2016,9,9,10.1016/j.molp.2016.06.018,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,EA4LZ,WOS:000386585500007,27403533,hybrid,

In this manuscript, I posit that these indices are necessary and specific for a particular stimulus, and are key determinants of a dynamic clustering that may function to mitigate the effects of this trigger. The protein(s)/sequence(s) that comprise this group are representative of all major kingdoms of life, and catalyze a generic hydroxylation, which is, in most cases accompanied by a specialized conversion of the substrate molecule. Iron is an essential co-factor for this transformation and the response to waning levels is systemic, and mandates the simultaneous participation of molecular sensors, transporters, and signal transducers. Here, I present a proof-of-concept model, that an evolving molecular network of 2OG-dependent enzymes can maintain iron homeostasis in the cytosol of root hair cells of members of the family Gramineae by actuating a non-reductive compensatory chelation by the phytosiderophores. Regression models of empirically available kinetic data (iron and alpha-ketoglutarate) were formulated, analyzed, and compared. The results, when viewed in context of the superfamily responding as a unit, suggest that members can indeed, work together to accomplish system-level function. This is achieved by the establishment of transient metabolic conduits, wherein the flux is dictated by kinetic compatibility of the participating enzymes. The approach adopted, i.e., predictive mathematical modeling, is integral to the hypothesis-driven acquisition of experimental data points and, in association with suitable visualization aids may be utilized for exploring complex plant biochemical systems.","Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Computat & Integrat Sci, New Delhi 110067, India",,"Kundu, S (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Computat & Integrat Sci, New Delhi 110067, India.",India,Asia,Global South,siddhartha_kundu@yahoo.co.in,,"Kundu, Siddhartha/0000-0003-3962-776X",,,138,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,15-Jul,2015,6,,10.3389/fpls.2015.00489,Plant Sciences,CN8HK,WOS:000358680800001,26236316,"gold, Green Published",Gold

IPO protein was also characterized as a defence-related protein, and it is also a carbohydrate-binding protein. In this study, the expression of IPO was used as a molecular probe to study the effects of Ca2+ on the signal transduction of ethylene. A confocal microscope monitored the Ca2+ within cells, and Northern blotting examined IPO expression. The presence of Ca2+ channel blocker, including diltiazem, neomycin or ruthenium red, abolished the increase of cytosolic Ca2+, and reduced the IPO expression in the cells induced by ethylene. Furthermore, both Ca2+ influxes and IPO expression stimulated by ethylene were prohibited in the presence of 10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). These results indicated that Ca2+ influxes into the cytosol induced by ethylene are from both apoplast and organelles, and are required for activating IPO expression. However, in the presence of 1 mM EGTA, ethylene can still stimulate IPO expression, but mechanical wounding failed to do it. Therefore, Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane induced by ethylene have higher affinity to Ca2+ than that stimulated by wounding. Moreover, the addition of A23187, an ionophore, raised cytosolic Ca2+, but was unable to stimulate IPO expression. These findings showed that IPO induction did not solely depend on Ca2+, and Ca2+ elevation in cytosol is necessary but not sufficient for IPO expression. The application of PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) inhibitor, did not prevent Ca2+ from increasing in the cytosol induced by ethylene, but inhibited the IPO expression stimulated by staurosporine (STA), a protein kinase inhibitor. Conclusively, elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ by ethylene may stimulate protein phosphatase and MAPKK, which finally activates IPO expression.","Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Hort & Biotechnol, Taipei, Taiwan; Washington State Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Plant Biol, Dept Life Sci, Taipei 106, Taiwan",,"Jeng, ST (corresponding author), Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Hort & Biotechnol, Taipei, Taiwan.",Taiwan,Asia,Global North,stjeng@ntu.edu.tw,"Lin, Hsin-Hung/AAH-5553-2021","Lin, Hsin-Hung/0000-0001-5150-7619; Jeng, Shih-Tong/0000-0002-3522-2792",,,58,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,JAN,2008,31,1,10.1111/j.1365-3040.2007.01742.x,Plant Sciences,237PH,WOS:000251387100005,17971062,"Bronze, Green Published",Bronze

VvACS1 is the only rachis-specific ACC synthase (ACS) gene, and its expression is coincident with ethylene production in the rachis of Vitis vinifera 'Thompson seedless'. VvACS1 was cloned and ectopically expressed in tomato (Solarium lycopersicum 'Moneymaker'). Lateral buds were increased in two- or four-week-old 35s: :VvACS1 transgenic tomato plants after transplanting. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, the transgenic tomato plants showed higher expression of the VvACS1 gene in the flowers, leaves, rachis, and fruits. There was no obvious difference of ACS activity in the fruit of tomato, and only increased ACS activity in the rachis of tomato. Ethylene production was decreased in flowers, leaves, and fruits (seven weeks after full bloom), while the relative expression of endogenous tomato ACS1 and ACS6 genes was not down-regulated by the ectopic expression of VvACS1. These results imply that post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation of ACS may occur, resulting in lower ethylene production in the transgenic tomato plants. Moreover, expression of VvACS1 in tomato resulted in decreased auxin and increased zeatin contents in the lateral buds, as well as reduced or delayed formation of adventitious roots in lateral bud cuttings. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analyses of rooted lateral bud cuttings indicated that the relative expression levels of the genes for zeatin O-glucosyltransferase-like, auxin repressed/dormancy-associated protein, and ERE transcription factors were higher in transgenic tomatoes than in WT, suggesting that ethylene may regulate auxin transport and distribution in shoots and that adventitious root formation employs coordination between auxin and ethylene.","[Ye, Xia; Fu, Mengmeng; Liu, Yu; An, Dongliang; Zheng, Xianbo; Tan, Bin; Li, Jidong; Cheng, Jun; Wang, Wei; Feng, Jiancan] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Hort, 95 Wenhua Rd, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China",,"Feng, JC (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Hort, 95 Wenhua Rd, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,jcfeng@henau.edu.cn,,"Li, Jidong/0000-0003-0503-5467; Feng, Jiancan/0000-0001-7468-8491",Major Science and Technology Project in Henan Province [151100110900]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31201605],"We thank Anita K.

However, ethylene gas may not be conveniently available to many laboratories for occasional use, and therefore several chemicals can be used as replacements. Here we report that the kinetics of the ethylene response induced by ethylene and two widely-used ethylene replacements are different. ACC failed to efficiently replace prolonged ethylene treatments, while the decomposition products of ethephon may cause non-specific responses and the efficiency of ethephon conversion to ethylene was relatively low. A cost-effective method to prepare ethylene gas was developed. Analyzed by gas chromatography, the chemically produced ethylene exhibited an identical chromatogram to that from the commercial source. Our synthetic ethylene gave the same dose-response curve in Arabidopsis as gaseous ethylene. Our study shows that the use of the ethylene gas is essential to experiments that are sensitive to treatment duration and dosage. When ACC and ethephon are used as replacements, caution should be taken in the experimental design. For laboratories that do not have an ethylene tank, ethylene gas can be easily prepared by a chemical approach without further purification. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

As the gaseous hormone ethylene exerts a profound effect on the progression of leaf senescence, both the optimal timing and amount of its biosynthesis are essential for controlled leaf development. The rate-limiting enzyme that controls ethylene synthesis in higher plants is ACC synthase (ACS). In this study, we evaluated the production of ethylene and revealed an up-regulation of ACS7 during leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. We further showed that the promoter activity of ACS7 was maintained at a relatively high level throughout the whole rosette development process. However, the accumulation level of ACS7 protein was extremely low in the light-grown young seedlings, and it was gradually restored as plants aging. We previously demonstrated that degradation of ACS7 is regulated by its first 14 N-terminal residues, here we compared the phenotypes of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing a truncated ACS7 lacking the 14 residues with transgenic plants overexpressing the full-length protein. Results showed that seedlings overexpressing the truncated ACS7 exhibited a senescence phenotype much earlier than their counterparts overexpressing the full-length gene. Fusion of the 14 residues to SSPP, a PP2C-type senescence-suppressed protein phosphatase, effectively rescued the SSPP-induced suppression of rosette growth and development but had no effect on the delayed senescence. This observation further supported that N-terminus-mediated degradation of ACS7 is negatively regulated by leaf senescence signaling. All results of this study therefore suggest that ACS7 is one of the major contributors to the synthesis of 'senescence ethylene'. And more importantly, the N-terminal 14 residue-mediated degradation of this protein is highly regulated by senescence signaling to enable plants to produce the appropriate levels of ethylene required.","[Sun, Gongling; Mei, Yuanyuan; Deng, Dewen; Xiong, Li; Sun, Lifang; Zhang, Xiyu; Wen, Zewen; Liu, Sheng; You, Xiang; Nasrullah; Wang, Dan; Wang, Ning Ning] Nankai Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Li] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Wang, NN (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,wangnn@nankai.edu.cn,"Nasrullah, Nasrullah/AAB-7916-2021","Mei, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-1846-5418; Sun, Lifang/0000-0002-7788-1569; Liu, Sheng/0000-0002-4873-9387; Wang, Ning Ning/0000-0001-5308-5878","Major Technological Program on Cultivation of New Varieties of Genetically Modified Organisms [2016ZX08010002-007]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31570293, 31370285]; 111 ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B08011]; Tianjin Research Program of Applied Basic and Cutting-Edge Technologies [16JCQNJC09300]","The authors acknowledge the financial supports from the Major Technological Program on Cultivation of New Varieties of Genetically Modified Organisms (Grant No. 2016ZX08010002-007), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 31570293 and 31370285), the 111 Project (Grant No. B08011) and the Tianjin Research Program of Applied Basic and Cutting-Edge Technologies (Grant No. 16JCQNJC09300).",47,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,6-Dec,2017,8,,10.3389/fpls.2017.02066,Plant Sciences,FO8LV,WOS:000417139000001,29270180,"Green Published, gold",Gold

Several studies in model plants have evaluated the importance of this hormone in crosstalk signaling with different metabolic pathways, in addition to responses to biotic stresses. However, the mechanism of action in plants of agricultural interest, such as soybean, and its participation in abiotic stresses remain unclear. Results: The studies presented in this work allowed for the identification of 176 soybean genes described elsewhere for ethylene biosynthesis (108 genes) and signal transduction (68 genes). A model to predict these routes in soybean was proposed, and it had great representability compared to those described for Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Furthermore, analysis of putative gene promoters from soybean gene orthologs permitted the identification of 29 families of cis-acting elements. These elements are essential for ethylene-mediated regulation and its possible crosstalk with other signaling pathways mediated by other plant hormones. From genes that are differentially expressed in the transcriptome database, we analyzed the relative expression of some selected genes in resistant and tolerant soybean plants subjected to water deficit. The differential expression of a set of five soybean ethylene-related genes (MAT, ACS, ACO, ETR and CTR) was validated with RT-qPCR experiments, which confirmed variations in the expression of these soybean target genes, as identified in the transcriptome database. In particular, two families of ethylene biosynthesis genes (ACS and ACO) were upregulated under these experimental conditions, whereas CTR (involved in ethylene signal transduction) was downregulated. In the same samples, high levels of ethylene production were detected and were directly correlated with the free fraction levels of ethylene's precursor. Thus, the combination of these data indicated the involvement of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in soybean responses to water stress. Conclusions: The in silico analysis, combined with the quantification of ethylene production (and its precursor) and RT-qPCR experiments, allowed for a better understanding of the importance of ethylene at a molecular level in this crop as well as its role in the response to abiotic stresses. In summary, all of the data presented here suggested that soybean responses to water stress could be regulated by a crosstalk network among different signaling pathways, which might involve various phytohormones, such as auxins, ABA and jasmonic acid. The integration of in silico and physiological data could also contribute to the application of biotechnological strategies to the development of improved cultivars with regard to different stresses, such as the isolation of stress-specific plant promoters.","[Monteiro Arraes, Fabricio Barbosa; Beneventi, Magda Aparecida] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Monteiro Arraes, Fabricio Barbosa; Beneventi, Magda Aparecida; Lisei de Sa, Maria Eugenia; Roca Paixao, Joaquin Felipe; Saliba Albuquerque, Erika Valeria; Grossi-de-Sa, Maria Fatima] Embrapa Genet Resources & Biotechnol, PqEB, BR-70770910 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Roca Paixao, Joaquin Felipe] Univ Brasilia, Inst Biol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Lisei de Sa, Maria Eugenia] Agr Res Co Minas Gerais State, BR-38001970 Uberaba, MG, Brazil; [Rockenbach Marin, Silvana Regina; Nepomuceno, Alexandre Lima] Embrapa Soybean, Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Purgatto, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Food Chem & Biochem Lab, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Grossi-de-Sa, Maria Fatima] Univ Catolica Brasilia, BR-70790160 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",,"Grossi-de-Sa, MF (corresponding author), Embrapa Genet Resources & Biotechnol, PqEB, Av W5 Norte, BR-70770910 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",Brazil,South America,Global South,fatima.grossi@embrapa.br,"Grossi-de-Sa, Maria Fatima/N-7856-2017; Purgatto, Eduardo/C-7707-2009; Arraes, Fabricio B.

Identifying cis-acting elements and transcription factors that play a role in this process, therefore, is important. Previously, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum [f. sp. Lycopersicon esculentum]) ERF protein, LeERF2, an allele of TERF2, was reported to confer ethylene triple response on plants. This paper reports the transcriptional modulation of LeERF2/TERF2 in ethylene biosynthesis in tomato and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Using overexpressing and antisense LeERF2/TERF2 transgenic tomato, we found that LeERF2/TERF2 is an important regulator in the expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes and the production of ethylene. Expression analysis revealed that LeERF2/TERF2 is ethylene inducible, and ethylene production stimulated by ethylene was suppressed in antisense LeERF2/TERF2 transgenic tomato, indicating LeERF2/TERF2 to be a positive regulator in the feedback loop of ethylene induction. Further research showed that LeERF2/TERF2 conservatively modulates ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco and that such regulation in tobacco is associated with the elongation of the hypocotyl and insensitivity to abscisic acid and glucose during germination and seedling development. The effects on ethylene synthesis were similar to those of another ERF protein, TERF1, because TERF1 and LeERF2/TERF2 have overlapping roles in the transcriptional regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco. Biochemical analysis showed that LeERF2/TERF2 interacted with GCC box in the promoter of NtACS3 and with dehydration-responsive element in the promoter of LeACO3, resulting in transcriptional activation of the genes for ethylene biosynthesis in tomato and tobacco, which is a novel regulatory function of ERF proteins in plant ethylene biosynthesis.","[Zhang, Zhijin; Zhang, Haiwen; Quan, Ruidan; Huang, Rongfeng] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Biotechnol Res Inst, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhijin; Wang, Xue-Chen] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Natl Lab Plant Physiol & Biochem, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhijin; Zhang, Haiwen; Quan, Ruidan; Huang, Rongfeng] Natl Key Facil Crop Gene Resources & Genet Improv, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhijin; Zhang, Haiwen; Quan, Ruidan; Huang, Rongfeng] Natl Ctr Plant Gene Res Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Huang, RF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Biotechnol Res Inst, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,rfhuang@caas.net.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30525034, 30871332, 30840055]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2006CB100102]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 30525034, 30871332, and 30840055) and the National Basic Research Program of China (grant no. 2006CB100102).",76,163,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,MAY,2009,150,1,10.1104/pp.109.135830,Plant Sciences,439XT,WOS:000265661700030,19261734,"Green Published, hybrid",

Plant height and leaf angle are two crucial determinants of plant architecture in maize (Zea mays) and are closely related to lodging resistance and canopy photosynthesis at high planting density. These two traits are primarily regulated by several phytohormones. However, the mechanism of ethylene in regulating plant architecture in maize, especially plant height and leaf angle, is unclear. Here, we characterized a maize mutant,Semidwarf3(Sdw3), which exhibits shorter stature and larger leaf angle than the wild type. Histological analysis showed that inhibition of longitudinal cell elongation in the internode and promotion in the auricle were mainly responsible for reduced plant height and enlarged leaf angle in theSdw3mutant. Through positional cloning, we identified a transposon insertion in the candidate geneZmACS7, encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) Synthase 7 in ethylene biosynthesis of maize. The transposon alters the C terminus of ZmACS7. Transgenic analysis confirmed that the mutantZmACS7gene confers the phenotypes of theSdw3mutant. Enzyme activity and protein degradation assays indicated that the altered C terminus of ZmACS7 in theSdw3mutant increases this protein's stability but does not affect its catalytic activity. The ACC and ethylene contents are dramatically elevated in theSdw3mutant, leading to reduced plant height and increased leaf angle. In addition, we demonstrated thatZmACS7plays crucial roles in root development, flowering time, and leaf number, indicating thatZmACS7is an important gene with pleiotropic effects during maize growth and development.","[Li, Hongchao; Liu, Meishan; Dong, Zhaobin; Fei, Shulang; Xiang, Hongtu; Jin, Weiwei] China Agr Univ, Ctr Crop Funct Genom & Mol Breeding,Coll Agron &, State Key Lab Plant Physiol & Biochem,Minist Educ, Natl Maize Improvement Ctr,Key Lab Crop Heterosis, Beijing 10093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lijing; Li, Qifang; Liu, Baoshen] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Agron, State Key Lab Crop Biol, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China",,"Jin, WW (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Ctr Crop Funct Genom & Mol Breeding,Coll Agron &, State Key Lab Plant Physiol & Biochem,Minist Educ, Natl Maize Improvement Ctr,Key Lab Crop Heterosis, Beijing 10093, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,weiweijin@cau.edu.cn,"; Dong, Zhaobin/O-7266-2018","Li, Hongchao/0000-0002-8195-2585; Dong, Zhaobin/0000-0002-1275-581X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91735305, 91535206, 31271734]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 91735305 and 91535206 to W.J., and 31271734 to B.L.).",96,14,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,JUL,2020,183,3,10.1104/pp.19.01421,Plant Sciences,MN2NE,WOS:000550682000032,32321843,Green Published,

The response of both salicylate and ethylene, the major phytohormones that modulate ozone-induced cell death, have now been analysed in SIPK-OX tobacco plants. Ozone treatment strongly induced ethylene formation in the sensitive SIPK-OX plants at ozone concentrations that failed to elicit stress ethylene release in WT plants.

The ethylene-signaling pathway is initiated by the induction of ethylene biosynthesis, which is under tight regulation at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by exogenous and endogenous cues. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the committing step of ethylene biosynthesis. Recently, we found that ACS2 and ACS6, two isoforms of the Arabidopsis ACS family, are substrates of a stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Phosphorylation of ACS2/ACS6 by MPK6 leads to the accumulation of ACS proteins and the induction of ethylene. In this report, we demonstrate that unphosphorylated ACS6 protein is rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome pathway. The degradation machinery targets the C-terminal non-catalytic domain of ACS6, which is sufficient to confer instability to green fluorescent protein and luciferase reporters. Phosphorylation of ACS6 introduces negative charges to the C-terminus of ACS6, which reduces the turnover of ACS6 by the degradation machinery. Consistent with this, other nearby conserved negatively charged amino acid residues are essential for ACS6 stability regulation. Protein degradation and phosphorylation are two important post-translational modifications of proteins. This research reveals an intricate interplay between these two important processes in controlling the levels of cellular ACS activity, and thus ethylene biosynthesis. The post-translational nature of both processes ensures a rapid response of ethylene induction, which is detectable within minutes after plants are exposed to stress.","[Joo, Sunjoo; Liu, Yidong; Lueth, Abraham; Zhang, Shuqun] Univ Missouri, Dept Biochem, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Joo, Sunjoo; Liu, Yidong; Lueth, Abraham; Zhang, Shuqun] Univ Missouri, Bond Life Sci Ctr, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",,"Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Biochem, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,zhangsh@missouri.edu,"Zhang, Shuqun/X-6343-2019",,,,53,159,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-7412,,APR,2008,54,1,10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03404.x,Plant Sciences,274TI,WOS:000254023600011,18182027,Bronze,Bronze

Of these hormones, ET evolution correlated best with O-3-induced cell death. Disruption of ET perception by transformation of birch with the dominant negative mutant allele etr1-1 of the Arabidopsis ET receptor gene ETR1 or blocking of ET perception with 1-methylcyclopropene reduced but did not completely prevent the O-3-induced cell death, when inhibition of ET biosynthesis with aminooxyacetic acid completely abolished O-3 lesion formation. This suggests the presence of an ET-signaling-independent but ET biosynthesis-dependent component in the ET-mediated stimulation of cell death in O-3-exposed birch. Functional ET signaling was required for the O-3 induction of the gene encoding beta-cyanoalanine synthase, which catalyzes detoxification of the cyanide formed during ET biosynthesis. The results suggest that functional ET signaling is required to protect birch from the O-3-induced cell death and that a decrease in ET sensitivity together with a simultaneous, high ET biosynthesis can potentially cause cell death through a deficient detoxification of cyanide.","Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Appl Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Lab Plant Physiol & Mol Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland",,"Kangasjarvi, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, POB 56,Viikinkaari 9, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Finland,Europe,Global North,jaakko.kangasjarvi@helsinki.fi,"Kangasjärvi, Jaakko/A-3024-2015; Tuominen, Hannele/E-7263-2013; Kangasjärvi, Jaakko/AAP-8639-2021; Tuominen, Hannele/D-9563-2014","Kangasjärvi, Jaakko/0000-0002-8959-1809; Tuominen, Hannele/0000-0002-4949-3702; Kangasjärvi, Jaakko/0000-0002-8959-1809; Tuominen, Hannele/0000-0002-4949-3702",,,59,79,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,MAY,2003,132,1,10.1104/pp.102.018887,Plant Sciences,717FR,WOS:000185076500022,12746524,"Bronze, Green Published",

Understanding the exact molecular mechanism for this process is important for elucidating the interconnection of ethylene and fruit quality. Overexpression of apple MdbHLH3 gene, an anthocyanin-related basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (bHLH TF) gene, promotes ethylene production, and transgenic apple plantlets and trees exhibit ethylene-related root developmental abnormalities, premature leaf senescence, and fruit ripening. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that MdbHLH3 binds to the promoters of three genes that are involved in ethylene biosynthesis, including MdACO1, MdACS1, and MdACS5A, activating their transcriptional expression, thereby promoting ethylene biosynthesis. High glucose-inhibited U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligase MdPUB29, the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtPUB29 in apple, influences the expression of ethylene biosynthetic genes and ethylene production by direct ubiquitination of the MdbHLH3 protein. Our findings provide new insights into the ubiquitination of MdbHLH3 by glucose-inhibited ubiquitin E3 ligase MdPUB29 in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis as well as indicate that the regulatory module MdPUB29-MdbHLH3 connects ethylene biosynthesis with fruit quality in apple.","[Hu, Da-Gang; Yu, Jian-Qiang; Han, Peng-Liang; Sun, Cui-Hui; Zhang, Quan-Yan; Wang, Jia-Hui; Hao, Yu-Jin] Shandong Agr Univ, Natl Key Lab Crop Biol, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Da-Gang; Yu, Jian-Qiang; Han, Peng-Liang; Sun, Cui-Hui; Zhang, Quan-Yan; Wang, Jia-Hui; Hao, Yu-Jin] Shandong Agr Univ, MOA Key Lab Hort Crop Biol & Germplasm Innovat, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Da-Gang; Yu, Jian-Qiang; Han, Peng-Liang; Sun, Cui-Hui; Zhang, Quan-Yan; Wang, Jia-Hui; Hao, Yu-Jin] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Hort Sci & Engn, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Xie, Xing-Bin] Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China",,"Hao, YJ (corresponding author), Shandong Agr Univ, Natl Key Lab Crop Biol, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Hao, YJ (corresponding author), Shandong Agr Univ, MOA Key Lab Hort Crop Biol & Germplasm Innovat, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Hao, YJ (corresponding author), Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Hort Sci & Engn, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,haoyujin@sdau.edu.cn,,"Hu, Dagang/0000-0002-1443-3646","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31601728, 31471854, 31772288]; Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [IRT15R42]; Shandong Province [ZR2016CQ13, SDAIT-06-03]; Shandong Agricultural University [564024, 24024]","We would like to thank Prof. Ai-De Wang of Shenyang Agricultural University of China, for anti-MdACS1 protein antibody, and Prof. Takaya Moriguchi of National Institute of Fruit Tree Science, Japan, for 'Orin' apple calli.

In this study, to evaluate the heterozygosity effect of rin on fruit ripening, we developed eight F-1 hybrid lines of the rin mutant from various crosses between the lines of the rin mutant and wild type. In the fruit of these F-1 hybrid lines, the shelf-life was improved, but both the shelf-life and colouring varied between the lines. We then chose one line of the F-1 hybrids and investigated the physiological and transcriptional properties of the fruit. Compared with the wild-type parent, this F-1 line showed about half the lycopene content, lower fruit softening and lower mRNA accumulation of the genes that encode phytoene synthase (Psy), polygalacturonase (PG), beta-galactosidase (TBG4) and expansin (LeEXP1). The characteristic climacteric rise in ethylene production typically observed in the wild-type parent during fruit maturation was not observed in the fruit of this F-1 line. The genes that encode ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, namely 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS2 and ACS4) and ACC oxidase (ACO1), were, however, significantly expressed in the F-1 hybrid, suggesting that the post-transcriptional regulator for activating these enzymes is affected by LeMADS-RIN. These results suggest that the heterologous effect of LeMADS-RIN in F-1 hybrids affects the gene transcription and activation of ripening-related factors, resulting in changes in fruit properties, including the extension of the shelf-life.","Natl Food Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058642, Japan; Kagome Co Ltd, Inst Res, Tochigi 3292762, Japan",,"Ito, Y (corresponding author), Natl Food Res Inst, 2-1-12 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058642, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,yasuito@affrc.go.jp,"Ito, Yasuhiro/W-5669-2019","Ito, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-7854-0360; SHIINA, TAKEO/0000-0003-2434-7634",,,42,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-9317,1399-3054,MAR,2005,123,3,10.1111/j.1399-3054.2005.00460.x,Plant Sciences,901YK,WOS:000227318000011,,,

The ethylene biosynthesis is regulated partly by nitric oxide (NO), a signal molecule involved in various physiological reactions. In order to investigate the effect of NO on key factors of ethylene biosynthesis, mature green tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum Mill. cv. Lichun) were treated with the NO synthesis inhibitor L-Nitro-arginine methylester (L-NAME). The results showed that L-NAME decreased endogenous ethylene release and delayed the breaker stage of fruits. In the process, the activities of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxide (ACO) were inhibited in accordance with the down-regulation of SlACS2/4 and SlACO1/3 genes. In addition, the expression of calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes, SlCDPK1/2 and SlMAPK1/2/3, was delayed or reduced.

This mutation is analogous to the dominant eto2 mutation that affects the C-terminal domain of the highly similar ACS5. Analysis of purified recombinant ACS5 and epitope-tagged ACS5 in transgenic Arabidopsis revealed that eto2 does not increase the specific activity of the enzyme either in vitro or in vivo; rather, it increases the half-life of the protein. In a similar manner, cytokinin treatment increased the stability of ACS5 by a mechanism that is at least partially independent of the eto2 mutation. The eto1 mutation was found to act by increasing the function of ACS5 by stabilizing this protein. These results suggest that an important mechanism by which ethylene biosynthesis is controlled is the regulation of the stability of ACS, mediated at least in part through the C-terminal domain.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,"Kieber, JJ (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,jkieber@unc.edu,,,,,46,286,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",1040-4651,1532-298X,FEB,2003,15,2,10.1105/tpc.006882,Plant Sciences,645YU,WOS:000181008700019,12566591,"Bronze, Green Published",Bronze

In vitro kinase assays were conducted on the type III ACS, AtACS7, fusion protein and peptides to determine whether the AtACS7 protein can be phosphorylated by calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK). AtACS7 was phosphorylated at Ser216, Thr296, and Ser299 by AtCDPK16 in vitro. To investigate further the function of the ACS7 gene in Arabidopsis, an acs7-1 loss-of-function mutant was isolated. The acs7-1 mutant exhibited less sensitivity to the inhibition of root gravitropism by treatment with the calcium chelator ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Seedlings were treated with gradient concentrations of ACC. The results showed that a certain concentration of ethylene enhanced the gravity response. Moreover, the acs7-1 mutant was less sensitive to inhibition of the gravity response by treatment with the auxin polar transport inhibitor 1-naphthylphthalamic acid, but exogenous ACC application recovered root gravitropism.

Although transcriptomic profiling of HLB-affected citrus plants has been studied extensively, the initial steps in pathogenesis have not been fully understood. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to compare very early transcriptional changes in the response of Valencia sweet orange (VAL) to CaLas after being fed by the vector, Diaphorina citri (Asian citrus psyllid, or ACP). The results suggest the existence of a delayed defense reaction against the infective vector in VAL, while the attack by the healthy vector prompted immediate and substantial transcriptomic changes that led to the rapid erection of active defenses. Moreover, in the presence of CaLas-infected psyllids, several downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified on the pathways, such as signaling, transcription factor, hormone, defense, and photosynthesis-related pathways at 1 day post-infestation (dpi). Surprisingly, a burst of DEGs (6,055) was detected at 5 dpi, including both upregulated and downregulated DEGs on the defense-related and secondary metabolic pathways, and severely downregulated DEGs on the photosynthesis-related pathways. Very interestingly, a significant number of those downregulated DEGs required ATP binding for the activation of phosphate as substrate; meanwhile, abundant highly upregulated DEGs were detected on the ATP biosynthetic and glycolytic pathways. These findings highlight the energy requirement of CaLas virulence processes. The emerging picture is that CaLas not only employs virulence strategies to subvert the host cell immunity, but the fast-replicating CaLas also actively rewires host cellular metabolic pathways to obtain the necessary energy and molecular building blocks to support virulence and the replication process. Taken together, the very early response of citrus to the CaLas, vectored by infective ACP, was evaluated for the first time, thus allowing the changes in gene expression relating to the primary mechanisms of susceptibility and host-pathogen interactions to be studied, and without the secondary effects caused by the development of complex whole plant symptoms.","[Wei, Xu; Mira, Amany; Yu, Qibin; Gmitter, Fred G., Jr.] Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA; [Wei, Xu] Southwest Univ, Coll Hort & Landscape, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Mira, Amany] Tanta Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Hort, Tanta, Egypt",,"Gmitter, FG (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,fgmitter@ufl.edu,,,"USDA Specialty Crop Research Initiative/Citrus Disease Research and Extension (SCRI/CDRE) [2015-70016-23027]; Citrus Research and Development Foundation [724, RMC 18-011]; Southwest University of ChinaSouthwest University - China [swu118044]; Egyptian Ministry of Higher EducationScience and Technology Development Fund (STDF) [3634]","This work was supported by grants from the USDA Specialty Crop Research Initiative/Citrus Disease Research and Extension (SCRI/CDRE; Award Number 2015-70016-23027) and from the Citrus Research and Development Foundation (724, and RMC 18-011).

We present the first in situ hybridization analysis of ACC synthase and an earlier time course of ACC oxidase gene expression. In immature ovaries, critical morphological changes involving cell differentiation and growth were affected by pollination and various hormone and inhibitor treatments. Patterns of ACC synthase and ACC oxidase mRNA accumulation were determined by RNA blot hybridization analysis. Gene expression analysis using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated that the unpollinated ovary had very low levels of ACC oxidase expression at 6 h and that pollination caused near-maximal levels in this organ by 12 h. Quantitative mRNA analysis showed that auxin could mimic pollination by inducing a similar pattern of organ-specific expression, but earlier and to higher levels. Ethylene had the most dramatic effect by inducing gene activity to its highest levels at all time points and in all floral organs. The early induction in situ hybridization analyses contribute new findings that ACC synthase and ACC oxidase transcripts were localized sequentially in epidermal, phloem, and parenchyma cells of the stigma and that by 8-12 h postpollination, saturation had occurred throughout the stigma. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of orchid ACC synthase proteins leads to the conclusion that at least a subgroup of the angiosperm ACC synthase gene family is induced by auxin but may not be posttranscriptionally regulated, indicating regulatory sequence but not functional divergence of orchid genes with other seed plant ACC synthase proteins.","[O'Neill, Sharman D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Biol, Coll Biol Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bui, Anhthu Q.] BASF Plant Sci LP, 26 Davis Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Potter, Daniel] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Zhang, Xian Sheng] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Crop Biol, 61 Dai Zong St, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China",,"O'Neill, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Biol, Coll Biol Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,sdoneill@ucdavis.edu,,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture CRIS project [CA-D-PLB-3504-H],"This work was supported by USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture CRIS project no.

Numerous similarities between the plant responses to O-3 and pathogens suggest that O-3 triggers hypersensitive response-like programmed cell death (PCD). We examined O-3 and superoxide-induced cell death in the O-3-sensitive radical-induced cell death1 (rcd1) mutant. Dying cells in O-3-exposed rcd1 exhibited several of the typical morphological characteristics of the hypersensitive response and PCD. Double-mutant analyses indicated a requirement for salicylic acid and the function of the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel AtCNGC2 in cell death. Furthermore, a requirement for ATPases, kinases, transcription, Ca2+ flux, caspase-like proteolytic activity, and also one or more phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-sensitive protease activities was shown for the development of cell death lesions in rcd1. Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein kinases showed differential activation patterns in rcd1 and Columbia. Taken together, these results directly demonstrate the induction of PCD by O-3.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Dept Stress & Dev Biol, D-06120 Halle Saale, Germany",,"Kangasjarvi, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Finland,Europe,Global North,jaakko.kangasjarvi@helsinki.fi,"Tuominen, Hannele/D-9563-2014; Kangasjärvi, Jaakko/A-3024-2015; Brosché, Mikael/H-2260-2015; Kangasjärvi, Jaakko/AAP-8639-2021; Tuominen, Hannele/E-7263-2013; Overmyer, Kirk/C-9708-2009","Tuominen, Hannele/0000-0002-4949-3702; Kangasjärvi, Jaakko/0000-0002-8959-1809; Brosché, Mikael/0000-0002-1135-2496; Kangasjärvi, Jaakko/0000-0002-8959-1809; Tuominen, Hannele/0000-0002-4949-3702; Overmyer, Kirk/0000-0002-7398-3453",,,60,144,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,MAR,2005,137,3,10.1104/pp.104.055681,Plant Sciences,910UH,WOS:000227957200031,15728341,"Green Published, Bronze",

Because many plants increase their ethylene production in response to hyyoxic stress, we examined in this report whether ethylene is involved in the hypoxic induction of ADH in Arabidopsis. We found that the hyyoxic induction of ADH can lac partially inhibited by aminooxy acetic acid, an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. This partial inhibition can be reversed by the addition of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, a direct precursor of ethylene. In addition, the hypoxic induction of the ADH gene is also reduced in etr1-1 and ein2-1, two ethylene insensitive mutants in ethylene-signaling pathways, whereas the addition of exogenous ethylene or an increase in cellular ethylene alone does not induce ADH under normoxic conditions. Kinetic analyses of ADH mRNA accumulation indicated that an ethylene signal is required for the induction of ADH during later stages of hypoxia. Therefore, we conclude that ethylene is needed, but not sufficient for, the induction of ADH in Arabidopsis during hypoxia.","Univ Iowa, Dept Sci Biol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Vegetable Crops, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Acad Sinica, Inst Bot, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Shih, MC (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Sci Biol, 204 Chem Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,,,,,,52,94,AMER SOC PLANT PHYSIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,JUN,2001,126,2,10.1104/pp.126.2.742,Plant Sciences,442QT,WOS:000169297000030,11402202,"Bronze, Green Published",

It specifically inhibits the enzyme activity of type 21-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthases (ACC synthases or ACS) and promotes their degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway. To further understand the function of the ETO1 family in the plant kingdom, we cloned a cDNA of LeEOL1 (Lycopersicon esculentum ETO1-LIKE 1), an ETO1 homolog from tomato. LeEOL1 encodes a putative protein with domain architecture conserved in the Arabidopsis ETO1/EOL1/EOL2 proteins and in the predicted rice EOL proteins. LeEOL1 is expressed in leaf, stem, root, flower, and the full ripe stage of fruit, suggesting diverse regulatory roles in the development of tomato. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed specific interactions between LeEOL1 and type 2 ACC synthases. When the C-terminal 14 amino acids (TOE; target of ETO1) of LE-ACS3 specific to type 2 ACC synthases were fused to a type 1 ACS, LE-ACS2, at the corresponding position, it allowed LE-ACS2 to strongly interact with LeEOL1. A GFP-TOE LE-ACS3 fusion protein expressed in rice calli and in the roots of wild-type Arabidopsis showed reduced stability compared to native GFP. However, the fluorescence of GFP-TOE LE-ACS3 was comparable to that of the native GFP in Arabidopsis eto1-4 mutant. Furthermore, MG132 treatment significantly enhanced the fluorescence of GFP-TOE LE-ACS3 in the roots of wild-type Arabidopsis. These results suggest that the ETO1-family-mediated ACS protein degradation pathway is conserved in both monocots and dicots, and that TOE acts as a protein destabilization signal recognized by the ETO1 protein family.","Acad Sinica, Inst Plant & Microbial Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Natl Agr Res Ctr, Rice Biotechnol Res Subteam, Niigata, Hokuriku Region 9430193, Japan",,"Yoshida, H (corresponding author), Plant Gen Ctr Co Ltd, Ibaraki 3050856, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,yocida@affrc.go.jp,"Ecker, Joseph R/B-9144-2008","Ecker, Joseph R/0000-0001-5799-5895",,,29,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4412,1573-5028,OCT,2006,62,3,10.1007/s11103-006-9029-7,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,103BR,WOS:000241861200008,16897471,,

Ethylene signaling is based on its biosynthesis in which ACC synthase (ACS) is the rate-limited enzyme and plays the most important role. By exploring the apple whole genome, we identified 19 ACS genes, and their expressions in fruit were investigated. Six ACS genes were expressed in fruit, including four new sequences. Out of these six genes, three were totally inhibited by 1-MCP (1-methylcyclopropene, an ethylene inhibitor), which were considered to work in System 2 ethylene; the others did not respond to 1-MCP, being considered to work in System 1 ethylene biosynthesis. This study showed that the whole genome can be used as a potential resource to identify new members of a multi-gene family important for a specific trait in apple. (c) 2013 The Authors.

While pre-climacteric petal tissues have a lower sensitivity to ethylene, these tissues are converted to the climacteric phase at a critical point during flower development. In this study, it is demonstrated that the senescence process initiated by exogenous ethylene is reversible in carnation petals. Petals treated with ethylene for 12 h showed sustained inrolling and senescence, while petals treated with ethylene for 10 h showed inrolling followed by recovery from inrolling. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed differential expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signalling between 10 h and 12 h ethylene treatment. Ethylene treatment at or beyond 12 h (threshold time) decreased the mRNA levels of the receptor genes (DcETR1, DcERS1, and DcERS2) and DcCTR genes, and increased the ethylene biosynthesis genes DcACS1 and DcACO1. In contrast, ethylene treatment under the threshold time caused a transient decrease in the receptor genes and DcCTR genes, and a transient increase in DcACS1 and DcACO1. Sustained DcACS1 accumulation is correlated with decreases in DcCTR genes and increase in DcEIL3 and indicates that tissues have entered the climacteric phase and that senescence proceeds irreversibly. Inhibition of ACS (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase) prior to 12 h ethylene exposure was not able to prevent reduction in transcripts of DcCTR genes, yet suppressed transcript of DcACS1 and DcACO1. This leads to the recovery from inrolling of the petals, indicating that DcACS1 may act as a signalling molecule in senescence of flowers.","[In, Byung-Chun; Falbel, Tanya G.; Patterson, Sara E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Hort, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Binder, Brad M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Biochem Cellular & Mol Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",,"Patterson, SE (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Hort, 1575 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,spatters@wisc.edu,,"Binder, Brad/0000-0002-8172-2034; In, Byung-Chun/0000-0003-0747-5925","Department of Horticulture, UW-Madison; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0918430] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Primary funding was provided by a gift from AgroFresh to SEP at UW-Madison.

Such peptide hormones (PHs) are involved in defense responses, shoot and root growth, meristem homeostasis, organ abscission, nutrient signaling, hormone crosstalk and other developmental processes and act as both short and long distant ligands. In this work, the function of CTG134, a peach gene encoding a ROOT GROWTH FACTOR/GOLVEN-like PH expressed in mesocarp at the onset of ripening, was investigated for its role in mediating an auxin-ethylene crosstalk. In peach fruit, where an auxin-ethylene crosstalk mechanism is necessary to support climacteric ethylene synthesis, CTG134 expression peaked before that of ACS1 and was induced by auxin and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatments, whereas it was minimally affected by ethylene. In addition, the promoter of CTG134 fused with the GUS reporter highlighted activity in plant parts in which the auxin-ethylene interplay is known to occur. Arabidopsis and tobacco plants overexpressing CTG134 showed abnormal root hair growth, similar to wild-type plants treated with a synthetic form of the sulfated peptide. Moreover, in tobacco, lateral root emergence and capsule size were also affected. In Arabidopsis overexpressing lines, molecular surveys demonstrated an impaired hormonal crosstalk, resulting in a re-modulated expression of a set of genes involved in both ethylene and auxin synthesis, transport and perception. These data support the role of pCTG134 as a mediator in an auxin-ethylene regulatory circuit and open the possibility to exploit this class of ligands for the rational design of new and environmental friendly agrochemicals able to cope with a rapidly changing environment.","[Busatto, Nicola; Salvagnin, Umberto; Resentini, Francesca; Quaresimin, Silvia; Navazio, Lorella; Trainotti, Livio] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy; [Busatto, Nicola; Costa, Fabrizio] Fdn Edmund Mach, Dept Genom & Crop Biol, Res & Innovat Ctr, Trento, Italy; [Marin, Oriano] Univ Padua, Dept Biomed Sci, Padua, Italy; [Pellegrini, Maria; Mierke, Dale F.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Chem, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",,"Trainotti, L (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy.",Italy,Europe,Global North,livio.trainotti@unipd.it,"Pellegrini, Maria/W-6005-2019; Busatto, Nicola/ABC-6355-2020; RESENTINI, FRANCESCA/W-4893-2017; Trainotti, Livio/F-4449-2015","Pellegrini, Maria/0000-0003-3817-4412; RESENTINI, FRANCESCA/0000-0003-0033-6930; Trainotti, Livio/0000-0002-8829-8205; Busatto, Nicola/0000-0002-3137-4836","MIUR (Italian Ministry of Research and University)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR); MiPAFF (Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali-Italy) [DM14999/7303/08]; University of Padova [CPDA072133/07, CPDA132841/13]","This work was supported by MIUR (Italian Ministry of Research and University), MiPAFF (Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali-Italy; www.politicheagricole.it) through the project 'DRUPOMICS' (grant DM14999/7303/08) and the University of Padova (grant CPDA072133/07 and CPDA132841/13).",65,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,11-Oct,2017,8,,10.3389/fpls.2017.01711,Plant Sciences,FJ4DP,WOS:000412685800002,29075273,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",Gold

RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN) is a transcription factor with transcriptional activator activity that plays a major role in regulating fruit ripening in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Recent studies have revealed that (1) RIN is indispensable for full ripening but not for the induction of ripening; and (2) the rin mutation, which produces nonripening fruits that never turn red or soften, is not a null mutation but instead converts the encoded transcriptional activator into a repressor. Here, we have uncovered aspects of RIN function by characterizing a series of allelic mutations within this locus that were produced by CRISPR/Cas9. Fruits of RIN-knockout plants, which are characterized by partial ripening and low levels of lycopene but never turn fully red, showed excess flesh softening compared to the wild type. The knockout mutant fruits also showed accelerated cell wall degradation, suggesting that, contrary to the conventional view, RIN represses over-ripening in addition to facilitating ripening. A C-terminal domain-truncated RIN protein, encoded by another allele of the RIN locus (rinG2), did not activate transcription but formed transcription factor complexes that bound to target genomic regions in a manner similar to that observed for wild-type RIN protein. Fruits expressing this truncated RIN protein exhibited extended shelf life, but unlike rin fruits, they accumulated lycopene and appeared orange. The diverse ripening properties of the RIN allelic mutants suggest that substantial phenotypic variation can be produced by tuning the activity of a transcription factor.","[Ito, Yasuhiro; Sekiyama, Yasuyo; Shima, Yoko; Nakamura, Nobutaka; Kotake-Nara, Eiichi; Kawasaki, Susumu] Natl Agr & Food Res Org NARO, Food Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058642, Japan; [Sekiyama, Yasuyo; Nakayama, Hiroko] NARO, Adv Anal Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058642, Japan; [Nishizawa-Yokoi, Ayako; Endo, Masaki; Hirose, Sakiko; Toki, Seiichi] NARO, Inst Agrobiol Sci, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan; [Toki, Seiichi] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Nanobiosci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360027, Japan; [Toki, Seiichi] Yokohama City Univ, Kihara Inst Biol Res, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2440813, Japan",,"Ito, Y (corresponding author), Natl Agr & Food Res Org NARO, Food Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058642, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,yasuito@affrc.go.jp,"Ito, Yasuhiro/W-5669-2019; Toki, Seiichi/AAR-1889-2021; Nishizawa-Yokoi, Ayako/AAT-9627-2021","Ito, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-7854-0360; Nishizawa-Yokoi, Ayako/0000-0003-2781-1359","Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP); Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry (JSBBA)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","This work was supported by the Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) and the Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry (JSBBA).",76,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,MAY,2020,183,1,10.1104/pp.20.00020,Plant Sciences,LS8PC,WOS:000536641800022,32094307,"Bronze, Green Published",

In kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.), fruit ripening is characterized by two distinct phases: an early phase of system-1 ethylene biosynthesis characterized by absence of autocatalytic ethylene, followed by a late burst of autocatalytic (system-2) ethylene accompanied by aroma production and further ripening. Progress has been made in understanding the transcriptional regulation of kiwifruit fruit ripening but the regulation of system-1 ethylene biosynthesis remains largely unknown. The aim of this work is to better understand the transcriptional regulation of both systems of ethylene biosynthesis in contrasting kiwifruit organs: fruit and leaves. Results A detailed molecular study in kiwifruit (A. chinensis) revealed that ethylene biosynthesis was regulated differently between leaf and fruit after mechanical wounding. In fruit, wound ethylene biosynthesis was accompanied by transcriptional increases in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS), ACC oxidase (ACO) and members of the NAC class of transcription factors (TFs). However, in kiwifruit leaves, wound-specific transcriptional increases were largely absent, despite a more rapid induction of ethylene production compared to fruit, suggesting that post-transcriptional control mechanisms in kiwifruit leaves are more important. One ACS member, AcACS1, appears to fulfil a dominant double role; controlling both fruit wound (system-1) and autocatalytic ripening (system-2) ethylene biosynthesis. In kiwifruit, transcriptional regulation of both system-1 and -2 ethylene in fruit appears to be controlled by temporal up-regulation of four NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2) TFs (AcNAC1-4) that induce AcACS1 expression by directly binding to the AcACS1 promoter as shown using gel-shift (EMSA) and by activation of the AcACS1 promoter in planta as shown by gene activation assays combined with promoter deletion analysis. Conclusions Our results indicate that in kiwifruit the NAC TFs AcNAC2-4 regulate both system-1 and -2 ethylene biosynthesis in fruit during wounding and ripening through control of AcACS1 expression levels but not in leaves where post-transcriptional/translational regulatory mechanisms may prevail.","[Nieuwenhuizen, Niels J.; Chen, Xiuyin; Pellan, Mickael; Zhang, Lei; Guo, Lindy; Atkinson, Ross G.; Allan, Andrew C.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd PFR, Private Bag 92169, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Nieuwenhuizen, Niels J.; Schaffer, Robert J.; Allan, Andrew C.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Zhang, Lei] Hubei Acad Agr Sci, Inst Fruit & Tea, Wuhan 430064, Peoples R China; [Laing, William A.] PFR, Private Bag 11600, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Schaffer, Robert J.] PFR, 55 Old Mill Rd,RD 3, Motueka 7198, New Zealand",,"Nieuwenhuizen, NJ (corresponding author), New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd PFR, Private Bag 92169, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.; Nieuwenhuizen, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",New Zealand,Oceania,Global North,niels.nieuwenhuizen@plantandfood.co.nz,"Schaffer, Robert J/D-1018-2011","Zhang, Lei/0000-0003-1966-0845","NZ Ministry of Business, Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [C11X1602]; Kiwifruit Royalty Investment Programme","This work was funded by the NZ Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (C11X1602) and internal PFR funding derived in part from the Kiwifruit Royalty Investment Programme.",95,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2229,,8-Sep,2021,21,1,10.1186/s12870-021-03154-8,Plant Sciences,UN1UF,WOS:000693806400001,34496770,"Green Published, gold",Gold

Peg initiation occurs in response to auxin when its levels in the concave side of the transition zone exceed a particular threshold through the graviresponse. Ethylene also plays an important role in peg formation, but its relationship to auxin in this event is not understood. Here, the role ethylene plays in auxin-induced peg formation is studied. Methods Peg formation of cucumber seedlings exposed to ethylene at different stages of growth or during exogenous auxin treatment was observed. In addition, ethylene evolution from the concave and convex sides of the transition zone was compared and their transcription of CS-ACS (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase) genes was analysed by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Key Results Seedlings treated with ethylene after peg initiation produced an enlarged peg, whereas ethylene treatment before peg initiation inhibited peg formation. Ethylene also promoted the development of the peg in the auxin-treated seedlings. Furthermore, the concave side of the transition zone at peg initiation produced more ethylene and CS-ACS1 mRNA than the convex side. Conclusions Since CS-ACS1 is an auxin-inducible gene, the greater abundance of auxin in the concave side of the transition zone causes peg initiation and increases CS-ACS1-mediated ethylene biosynthesis, which then facilitates peg development.

The transgenic tomato exhibited ethylene insensitivity phenotypes such as non-ripening and the lack of the triple response and petiole epinasty of seedlings even in the presence of exogenous ethylene. Transgenic fruit exhibited a low but consistent increase in ethylene production beyond 40 days after anthesis (DAA), with limited LeACS2 and LeACS4 expression. 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a potent inhibitor of ethylene perception, failed to inhibit the limited increase in ethylene production and expression of the two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) genes in the transgenic fruit. These results suggest that ripening-associated ethylene (system 2) in wild-type tomato fruit consists of two parts: a small part regulated by a developmental factor through the ethylene-independent expression of LeACS2 and LeACS4 and a large part regulated by an autocatalytic system due to the ethylene-dependent expression of the same genes. The results further suggest that basal ethylene (system 1) is less likely to be involved in the transition to system 2. Even if the effect of system 1 ethylene is eliminated, fruit can show a small increase in ethylene production due to unknown developmental factors. This increase would be enough for the stimulation of autocatalytic ethylene production, leading to fruit ripening.","[Nakano, Ryohei; Inaba, Akitsugu; Kubo, Yasutaka] Okayama Univ, Fac Agr, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Yokotani, Naoki] Res Inst Biol Sci, Kibichuo, Okayama 7161241, Japan; [Imanishi, Shunsuke; Nagata, Masayasu] Natl Agr & Food Res Org NARO, Natl Inst Vegetable & Tea Sci, Postharvest Res Team, Tsu, Mie 5142392, Japan",,"Kubo, Y (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Fac Agr, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,ykubo@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp,,"NAKANO, Ryohei/0000-0001-5042-1725; KUBO, Yasutaka/0000-0002-2442-6829","National BioResource Project (NBRP), MEXT, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20380022]","We thank Dr Harry Klee (University of Florida, USA) and Dr Francis M Mathooko (Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya) for careful reading of and useful comments on this paper.

Although much is known about fruit development and climacteric ripening, little information is available about how ethylene biosynthesis is regulated during the postclimacteric phase. A targeted systems biology approach revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of ethylene biosynthesis of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) when fruit have reached their maximal ethylene production level and which is characterized by a decline in ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene production is shut down at the level of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase. At the same time, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase activity increases. Analysis of the Yang cycle showed that the Yang cycle genes are regulated in a coordinated way and are highly expressed during postclimacteric ripening. Postclimacteric red tomatoes on the plant showed only a moderate regulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase and Yang cycle genes compared with the regulation in detached fruit. Treatment of red fruit with 1-methylcyclopropane and ethephon revealed that the shut-down mechanism in ethylene biosynthesis is developmentally programmed and only moderately ethylene sensitive. We propose that the termination of autocatalytic ethylene biosynthesis of system 2 in ripe fruit delays senescence and preserves the fruit until seed dispersal.","[Van de Poel, Bram; Bulens, Inge; Markoula, Aikaterina; Hertog, Maarten L.

Here, we report that early fruit development is also dramatically altered by the single-gene dgt lesion. Fruit weight, fruit set, and numbers of locules and seeds are reduced in dgt. In addition, time to flowering and time from anthesis to the onset of fruit ripening are increased by the dgt lesion, whereas ripening is normal. The dgt mutation appears to affect only the early stages of fruit development, irrespective of allele or genetic background. Expression of members of the LeACS (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase, a key regulatory enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis) and LelAA (Aux/IAA, auxin-responsive) gene families were quantified via real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in both dgt and wild-type fruits, providing the first analysis of Aux/IAA gene expression in fruit. The dgt lesion affects the expression of only certain members of both the LeACS and LeIAA multigene families. Different subsets of LeIAA gene family members are affected by the dgt mutation in fruits and hypocotyls, indicating that the DGT gene product functions in a developmentally specific manner. The differential expression of subsets of LeIAA and LeACS gene family members as well as the alterations in dgt fruit morphology and growth suggest that the early stages of fruit development in tomato are regulated, at least in part, by auxin- and ethylene-mediated gene expression.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"Lomax, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,,,,,,65,66,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,JAN,2003,131,1,10.1104/pp.010132,Plant Sciences,638UH,WOS:000180589500022,12529527,"Green Published, Bronze",

For some banana varieties, this is a major feature of the ripening process, in addition to ethylene production and sugar metabolism. The few studies devoted to assessing the physiological and molecular basis of this process revealed (i) the similarity between this process and softening, (ii) the early onset of related molecular events, between the first and fourth day after ripening induction, and (iii) the putative involvement of ethylene as a regulatory factor. This study was conducted with the aim of identifying, through a candidate gene approach, a quality-related marker that could be used as a tool in breeding programmes. Here we examined the relationship between ripening ethylene biosynthesis (EB) and finger drop in order to gain further insight into the upstream regulatory steps of the banana finger drop process and to identify putative related candidate genes. Methods Postharvest ripening of green banana fruit was induced by acetylene treatment and fruit taken at 1-4 days after ripening induction, and total RNA extracted from the median area [control zone (CZ)] and the pedicel rupture area [drop zone (DZ)] of peel tissue. Then the expression patterns of EB genes (MaACO1, MaACO2, MaACS1, MaACS2, MaACS3 and MaACS4) were comparatively examined in CZ and DZ via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Principal results Differential expression of EB gene was observed in CZ and DZ during the postharvest period examined in this study. MaACO1, MaACS2 and MaACS1 were more highly induced in DZ than in the control, while a slight induction of the MaACS4 gene was observed. No marked differences between the two zones were observed for the MaACO2 gene. Conclusions The finger drop process enhanced EB gene expression including developmental- and ripening-induced genes (MaACO1), specific ripening-induced genes (MaACS1) and wound-induced genes (MaACS2). Thus, this process might be associated with a specific ethylene production in DZ of the pedicel area and the result of crosstalk between developmental, ripening and wound regulatory pathways. MaACO1, MaACS1, MaACS2, and to a lesser extent MaACS4 genes, which are more highly induced in DZ than in CZ, could be considered as putative candidates of the finger drop process.","[Hubert, Olivier; Mbeguie-A-Mbeguie, Didier] CIRAD, UMR QUALISUD, F-97130 Capesterre Belle Eau, Guadeloupe, France; [Hubert, Olivier; Mbeguie-A-Mbeguie, Didier] CIRAD, UMR QUALISUD, F-34398 Montpellier, France",,"Mbeguie-A-Mbeguie, D (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR QUALISUD, F-97130 Capesterre Belle Eau, Guadeloupe, France.",France,Europe,Global North,didier.mbeguie-a-mbeguie@cirad.fr,"MBEGUIE-A-MBEGUIE, Didier/C-8641-2009",,Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional (FEDER) Convergence: Guadeloupe; Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional (FEDER) Convergence: Guadeloupe,The work is a part of the ongoing research project 'Qualite des Produits Vegetaux' funded by the Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional (FEDER) Convergence: Guadeloupe 2007-2013.,48,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,2012,,,10.1093/aobpla/pls041,Plant Sciences; Ecology,229KZ,WOS:000325264700017,23267429,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",

At present, the signaling pathways underlying the induction of ethylene after pathogen infection are largely unknown. MPK6, an Arabidopsis stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was previously shown to regulate the stability of ACS2 and ACS6, two type I ACS isozymes (1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase). Phosphorylation of ACS2 and ACS6 by MPK6 prevents rapid degradation of ACS2/ACS6 by the 26S proteasome pathway, resulting in an increase in cellular ACS activity and ethylene biosynthesis. Here, we show that MPK3, which shares high homology and common upstream MAPK kinases with MPK6, is also capable of phosphorylating ACS2 and ACS6. In the mpk3 mutant background, ethylene production in gain-of-function GVG-NtMEK2DD transgenic plants was compromised, suggesting that MPK6 and MPK3 function together to stabilize ACS2 and ACS6. Using a liquid-cultured seedling system, we found that B. cinerea-induced ethylene biosynthesis was greatly compromised in mpk3/mpk6 double mutant seedlings. In contrast, ethylene production decreased only slightly in the mpk6 single mutant and not at all in the mpk3 single mutant, demonstrating overlapping roles for these two highly homologous MAPKs in pathogen-induced ethylene induction. Consistent with the role of MPK3/MPK6 in the process, mutation of ACS2 and ACS6, two genes encoding downstream substrates of MPK3/MPK6, also reduced B. cinerea-induced ethylene production. The residual levels of ethylene induction in the acs2/acs6 double mutant suggest the involvement of additional ACS isoforms, possibly regulated by MAPK-independent pathway(s).","[Zhang, Shuqun] Univ Missouri, Div Biochem, Interdisciplinary Plant Grp, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; Univ Missouri, Bond Life Sci Ctr, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",,"Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biochem, Interdisciplinary Plant Grp, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,zhangsh@missouri.edu,"Zhang, Shuqun/X-6343-2019","Li, Guojing/0000-0001-7882-3523",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0543109]; Research Experiences for Graduates supplement,"We thank Kristin Bruffett for her help with greenhouse work and genotyping of plants, Melody Kroll for proofreading the manuscript, Joseph Kieber for the acs5 and acs9 mutant seeds, N.-H.

Here, we explore the mechanism by which cytokinins and brassinosteroids affect ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene biosynthesis is regulated in response to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous signals, including the levels of other phytohormones. Cytokinins act by increasing the stability of a subset of ACC synthases, which catalyze the generally rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis. The induction of ethylene by cytokinin requires the canonical cytokinin two-component response pathway, including histidine kinases, histidine phosphotransfer proteins and response regulators. The cytokinin-induced myc-ACS5 stabilization occurs rapidly (< 60 min), consistent with a primary output of this two-component signaling pathway. We examined the mechanism by which another phytohormone, brassinosteroid, elevates ethylene biosynthesis in etiolated seedlings. Similar to cytokinin, brassinosteroid acts post-transcriptionally by increasing the stability of ACS5 protein, and its effects on ACS5 were additive with those of cytokinin. These data suggest that ACS is regulated by phytohormones through regulatory inputs that probably act together to continuously adjust ethylene biosynthesis in various tissues and in response to various environmental conditions.","[Hansen, Maureen; Chae, Hyun Sook; Kieber, Joseph J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,"Kieber, JJ (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,jkieber@unc.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB0541973]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM007092] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by a National Science Foundation grant (MCB0541973) to J.

To identify the stress-related signalling pathways and possible cross-talk controlled by an ABA-negative regulator, the protein phosphatase 2C abscisic acid insensitive1 (ABI1), we performed a genome-wide transcription profiling of O-3-treated wild-type and ABI1 knockout (abi1td) plants. In addition, to better understand ABA signalling and the interactions between stress response pathways, we performed a microarray analysis of drought-treated plants. Functional categorization of the identified genes showed that ABI1 is involved in the modulation of several cellular processes including metabolism, transport, development, information pathways and variant splicing. Comparisons with available transcriptome data sets revealed the extent of ABI1 involvement in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent gene expression. Furthermore, in O-3 stress the ABA hypersensitivity of abi1td resulted in a significant reduction of the ABA level, ethylene (ET) over-production and O-3 tolerance. Moreover, the physical interaction of ABI1 with ACC synthase2 and ACC synthase6 was shown. We provide a model explaining how ABI1 can regulate both ABA and ET biosynthesis. Altogether, our findings indicate that ABI1 plays the role of a general signal transducer linking ABA and ET biosynthesis as well as signalling pathways to O-3 stress tolerance.","[Ludwikow, Agnieszka; Kierzek, Dorota; Sadowski, Jan] Adam Mickiewicz Univ Poznan, Dept Biotechnol, Fac Biol, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Gallois, Patrick; Zeef, Leo] Univ Manchester, Sch Biol Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England",,"Sadowski, J (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ Poznan, Dept Biotechnol, Fac Biol, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Umultowska 89, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",Poland,Europe,Global North,jsad@amu.edu.pl,"Ludwikow, Agnieszka/Q-8964-2018; Zeef, Leo/D-6922-2011; Ludwikow, Agnieszka/P-1977-2019","Ludwikow, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6393-544X; Ludwikow, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6393-544X; GALLOIS, Patrick/0000-0002-6305-2807","Polish Committee for Scientific ResearchPolish State Committee for Scientific Research [PBZ/KBN/029/P06/2000, PBZ-MNiSW-2/3/2006/19, PBZ-MNil-2/1/2005]; Marie Curie FellowshipEuropean Commission [EC QLK5-1999-50413]","The work was supported by the Polish Committee for Scientific Research Grants PBZ/KBN/029/P06/2000, PBZ-MNiSW-2/3/2006/19 and PBZ-MNil-2/1/2005 to J.

Oligogalacturonides (OGs), linear fragments derived from homogalacturonan hydrolysis by pathogen-secreted cell wall-degrading enzymes, and flg22, a 22-amino acid peptide derived from the bacterial flagellin, represent prototypical DAMPs and MAMPs, respectively. Both types of molecules induce protection against infections. In plants, like in animals, calcium is a second messenger that mediates responses to biotic stresses by activating calcium-binding proteins. Here we show that simultaneous loss of calcium-dependent protein kinases CPK5, CPK6 and CPK11 affects Arabidopsis thaliana basal as well as elicitor-induced resistance to the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea, by affecting pathogen-induced ethylene production and accumulation of the ethylene biosynthetic enzymes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase 2 (ACS2) and 6 (ACS6). Moreover, ethylene signaling contributes to OG-triggered immunity activation, and lack of CPK5, CPK6 and CPK11 affects the duration of OG- and flg22-induced gene expression, indicating that these kinases are shared elements of both DAMP and MAMP signaling pathways.","[Gravino, Matteo; Savatin, Daniel Valentin; De Lorenzo, Giulia] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biol & Biotecnol C Darwin, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Macone, Alberto] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Biochim A Rossi Fanelli, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,"Savatin, DV (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biol & Biotecnol C Darwin, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",Italy,Europe,Global North,daniel.savatin@uniroma1.it,"Savatin, Daniel/W-5577-2019; De Lorenzo, Giulia/F-5475-2013; Macone, Alberto/AAB-2570-2019","Savatin, Daniel/0000-0002-2165-1369; De Lorenzo, Giulia/0000-0002-1707-5418; Macone, Alberto/0000-0003-0455-1400; GRAVINO, Matteo/0000-0002-3596-8172",European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [233083]; Universita di Roma Sapienza PROGETTI AWARDS [2014 - C26H14CEJA],We thank Professor Felice Cervone and Dr Simone Ferrari for a critical reading of the manuscript and helpful suggestions.

Sensing the calcium signals elicited by a variety of abiotic stresses, CBLs transmit the information to a group of serine/ threonine protein kinases (CBL-interacting protein kinases [CIPKs]), which are currently known as the sole targets of the CBL family. Here, we report that the CBL3 member of this family has a novel interaction partner in addition to the CIPK proteins. Extensive yeast two-hybrid screenings with CBL3 as bait identified an interesting Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cDNA clone (named AtMTAN, for 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase), which encodes a polypeptide similar to EcMTAN from Escherichia coli. Deletion analyses showed that CBL3 utilizes the different structural modules to interact with its distinct target proteins, CIPKs and AtMTAN. In vitro and in vivo analyses verified that CBL3 and AtMTAN physically associate only in the presence of Ca2+. In addition, we empirically demonstrated that the AtMTAN protein indeed possesses the MTAN activity, which can be inhibited specifically by Ca2+-bound CBL3. Overall, these findings suggest that the CBL family members can relay the calcium signals in more diverse ways than previously thought. We also discuss a possible mechanism by which the CBL3-mediated calcium signaling regulates the biosynthesis of ethylene and polyamines, which are involved in plant growth and development as well as various stress responses.","[Oh, Seung-Ick; Park, Jimyeong; Yoon, Sunhee; Kim, Yungyeong; Park, Soojin; Ryu, Migyeong; Nam, Min Jung; Kim, Kyung-Nam] Sejong Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Seoul 143747, South Korea; [Oh, Seung-Ick; Ok, Sung Han; Kim, Jeong-Kook; Shin, Jeong-Sheop] Korea Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Seoul 136701, South Korea",,"Kim, KN (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Seoul 143747, South Korea.",South Korea,Asia,Global North,knkim@sejong.ac.kr,"Kim, Kyung-Nam/AAI-6518-2020",,"Korean governmentKorean Government [R01-2006-000-11164-0, KRF-2007-313-C00686]; Korea Science and Engineering FoundationKorea Science and Engineering Foundation","This work was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, funded by the Korean government (grant no.

A detailed model that describes ethylene biochemistry dynamics is missing. Often, kinetic modeling is used to describe metabolic networks or signaling cascades, mostly ignoring the link with transcriptomic data. We have constructed an elegant kinetic model that describes the transfer of genetic information into abundance and metabolic activity of proteins for the entire ethylene biosynthesis pathway during fruit development and ripening of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Our model was calibrated against a vast amount of transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic data and showed good descriptive qualities. Subsequently it was validated successfully against several ripening mutants previously described in the literature. The model was used as a predictive tool to evaluate novel and existing hypotheses regarding the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. This bottom-up kinetic network model was used to indicate that a side-branch of the ethylene pathway, the formation of the dead-end product 1-(malonylamino)-1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (MACC), might have a strong effect on eventual ethylene production. Furthermore, our in silico analyses indicated potential (post-) translational regulation of the ethylene-forming enzyme ACC oxidase.","[Van de Poel, Bram; Bulens, Inge; Hertog, Maarten L. A. T.

In the present study, femaleness of cucumber occurred under short-day (8 h photoperiod) conditions compared to that under long-day (16 h photoperiod) conditions, although the effect of photoperiod was more pronounced in a monoecious than in an andromonoecious cucumber. Application of ethylene had a greater effect than photoperiod on the production of female and bisexual flowers in monoecious and andromonoecious cucumbers, respectively. Ethylene evolution and the expression of CS-ACS2 , CS-ACS4 and CS-ERS genes in the shoot apices of both monoecious and andromonoecious cucumber plants had a diurnal rhythm with a peak in the middle of an 8 h or a 16 h light period. Peak ethylene evolution and expression of CS-ACS2 was greater under short-day conditions than under long-day conditions in a monoecious cucumber but not in an andromonoecious one. Expression of CS-ACS4 in monoecious and andromonoecious cucumber plants did not differ, but the level was higher under short-day conditions compared with that under long-day conditions. Thus, CS-ACS2 and CS-ACS4 might be involved in the basic diurnal rhythm of ethylene evolution in cucumber. Because exogenous ethylene increased the expression of CS-ACS2 and CS-ERS in monoecious cucumber possessing the M locus, but not in andromonoecious cucumber in which the function of the M locus was lost (Yamasaki et al . Plant and Cell Physiology 42, 608-619, 2001), the CS-ACS2 gene might also be involved in ethylene production by positive feedback via regulation of M locus under short-day conditions.","Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan",,"Takahashi, H (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,,"Fujii, Nobuharu/AAH-7402-2019",,,,45,47,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0140-7791,,APR,2003,26,4,10.1046/j.1365-3040.2003.00984.x,Plant Sciences,663MP,WOS:000182009600006,,Bronze,Bronze

Ps-ACS1 accumulated during fruit ripening of ` Early Golden' ('EG') and ` 'Shiro' ('SH') in ethylene-dependent and - independent manners, respectively. Ps-ACS3a transcripts accumulated throughout fruit development and during 'EG' fruit ripening. Ps-ACS3b was detected only during ripening of 'SH' fruit. Furthermore, Ps-ACS3a transcript accumulation was negatively regulated by ethylene, whereas Ps-ACS3b was positively induced by the hormone. In both cultivars, the expression of Ps-ACS4 and - 5 is under positive and negative feedback control by ethylene, respectively.

Commercially relevant transgenic events were created with down-regulated ACC synthases (ACSs), enzymes that catalyse the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis. These events had ethylene emission levels reduced approximately 50% compared with nontransgenic nulls. Multiple, independent transgenic hybrids and controls were tested in field trials at managed drought-stress and rain-fed locations throughout the US. Analysis of yield data indicated that transgenic events had significantly increased grain yield over the null comparators, with the best event having a 0.58 Mg/ha (9.3 bushel/acre) increase after a flowering period drought stress. A (genotype 9 transgene) 9 environment interaction existed among the events, highlighting the need to better understand the context in which the down-regulation of ACSs functions in maize. Analysis of secondary traits showed that there was a consistent decrease in the anthesis-silking interval and a concomitant increase in kernel number/ear in transgene-positive events versus nulls. Selected events were also field tested under a low-nitrogen treatment, and the best event was found to have a significant 0.44 Mg/ha (7.1 bushel/acre) yield increase.

For this, we chose 11 different phases of silique development, the first being the recently fertilized pistil and the last being the silique just prior to its dehiscence (ca, 2 months post-anthesis), In the 11 phases, ethylene production was detected in both whole silique (with or without seeds) and in the seeds enclosed by the silique wall. The levels of ACC, ACO and ethylene production proved high in seeds belonging to: (1) the pod in the very early phases, when the seeds mere growing but without photosynthetic competence; (2) the silique at maximum growth, in which the seeds will initiate desiccation and loss of photosynthetic activity. During the phases prior to dehiscence, there was a marked inhibition in the last step of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, In viable dry seeds, no ACO activity was detected and the ACC levels were 4-fold lower than at the onset of the silique senescence. Germination brings about a net synthesis of ACC with respect of the stores dry seed. This fact, together with other results presented in this work, point towards, as in other seeds, a dependence of ethylene synthesis for radicle emergence. The possible role played by the silique wall in the control of ethylene biosynthesis during zygotic embryogenesis, as well as the participation of ethylene as a hormonal signal in the triggering of seed desiccation in Brassica rapa cv, Rapa, are discussed in depth.","Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Farm, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, Dept Biol Vegetal, E-15706 Santiago, Spain",,"Matilla, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Farm, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, Dept Biol Vegetal, E-15706 Santiago, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,bvmatilla@usc.es,,,,,65,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-9317,1399-3054,JUN,2001,112,2,10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120216.x,Plant Sciences,438YB,WOS:000169080900016,11454233,,

The aims of the present work were to determine the sensitivity of Plectranthus cultivars to applied ethylene, to alleviate ethylene- and shipping-induced flower abscission in intact potted plants using 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), and to investigate the possible causes of dark-induced flower abscission. All cultivars were sensitive to ethylene in a concentration-dependent manner, and complete abscission occurred within 24 h with 1 and 2 mu l l(-1) ethylene. Unopened buds were more sensitive to applied ethylene, and exhibited greater abscission than open flowers. Ethylene synthesis remained below detection limits at all time points under control and continuous dark conditions. Dark treatment significantly increased flower abscission in Plectranthus cultivars, and like ethylene-induced flower abscission, this could be prevented by continuous 1-MCP treatment. Gene expression of ethylene biosynthetic enzymes ACS and ACO was examined as possible causes for the accelerated flower abscission observed in plants kept in continuous darkness. Expression patterns of ACS and ACO varied between different cultivars of Plectranthus. In some cases, increased expression of ACS and ACO led to increased flower abscission. Gene expression was higher in open flowers when compared to unopened flowers suggesting a cause for the observed preferential shedding of open flowers in some cultivars. Although the cause of dark-induced abscission in Plectranthus remains elusive, it can be effectively controlled by treatment with 1-MCP. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) ethylene promotes root elongation in a concentration dependent manner. However, the crosstalk between ethylene and auxin remains unknown during sugar beet seedling development. Our experiments have shown that exogenously applied auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) also stimulates root elongation. We also show that auxin promotes ethylene biosynthesis leading to longer roots. We have further demonstrated that the auxin treatment stimulates ethylene production by redirecting the pool of available 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) toward ethylene instead of malonyl-ACC (MACC) resulting in a prolonged period of high rates of ethylene production and subsequently a longer root. On the other hand we have also shown that endogenous IAA levels were not affected by an ACC treatment during germination. All together our findings suggest that the general model for auxin-ethylene crosstalk during early root development, where ethylene controls auxin biosynthesis and transport, does not occur in sugar beet. On the contrary, we have shown that the opposite, where auxin stimulates ethylene biosynthesis, is true for sugar beet root development.","[Abts, Willem; De Proft, Maurice P.; Van de Poel, Bram] Univ Leuven, Dept Biosyst, Div Crop Biotech, Leuven, Belgium; [Vandenbussche, Bert] SESVanderHave NV, Tienen, Belgium; [Abts, Willem] Bayer Crop Sci, Diegem, Belgium",,"Van de Poel, B (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Dept Biosyst, Div Crop Biotech, Leuven, Belgium.",Belgium,Europe,Global North,bram.vandepoel@kuleuven.be,"Van de Poel, Bram/N-1774-2015","Van de Poel, Bram/0000-0001-5638-2472","Department of Biosystems, University of Leuven; Belgian American Educational Foundation; Special Research Fund of the University of Leuven","This research and the position of WA was funded by the Department of Biosystems, University of Leuven.

It has also been shown that both CS-ACS2 gene expression and ethylene evolution are much greater in gynoecious cucumber plants than monoecious ones. To investigate the action mechanism of ethylene in the induction of femaleness of cucumber flowers, we isolated three ethylene-receptor-related genes, CS-ETR1, CS-ETR2 and CS-ERS, from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) plants. Of these three genes, CS-ETR2 and CS-ERS mRNA accumulated more substantially in the shoot apices of the gynoecious cucumber than those of the monoecious one. Their expression patterns correlated with the expression of the CS-ACS2 gene and with ethylene evolution in the shoot apices of the two types of cucumber plants. Accumulation of CS-ETR2 and CS-ERS mRNA was significantly elevated by the application of Ethrel, an ethylene-releasing agent, to the shoot apices of monoecious cucumber plants. In contrast, the accumulation of their transcripts was lowered when aminoethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG), an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, was applied to the shoot apices of gynoecious cucumber plants. Thus, the expression of CS-ETR2 and CS-ERS is, at least in part, regulated by ethylene. The greater accumulation of CS-ETR2 and CS-ERS mRNA in gynoecious cucumber plants may be due to the higher level of endogenous ethylene, which plays a role in the development of female flowers.","Tohoku Univ, Inst Genet Ecol, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan",,"Takahashi, H (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Inst Genet Ecol, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,,"Fujii, Nobuharu/AAH-7402-2019",,,,35,97,JAPANESE SOC PLANT PHYSIOLOGISTS,KYOTO,"SHIMOTACHIURI OGAWA HIGASHI KAMIKYOKU, KYOTO, 602, JAPAN",0032-0781,,MAY,2000,41,5,,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,317UH,WOS:000087245000010,10929944,Bronze,

Genetic characterization of ethylene mutants and treatments with exogenous molecules suggest that, in this species, ACC and ethylene have independent functions. The plant hormone ethylene has many roles in growth and development(1). In seed plants, the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is converted into ethylene by ACC oxidase (ACO), and treatment with ACC induces ethylene responses(2). However, non-seed plants lack ACO homologues(3-8), which led us to examine the relationship between ACC and ethylene in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Here, we demonstrate that ACC and ethylene can induce divergent growth responses in Marchantia. Ethylene increases plant and gemma size, induces more gemma cups and promotes gemmae dormancy. As predicted, Mpctr1-knockout mutants display constitutive ethylene responses, whereas Mpein3-knockout mutants exhibit ethylene insensitivity. Compared with the wild type, Mpctr1 gemmae have more and larger epidermal cells, whereas Mpein3 gemmae have fewer and smaller epidermal cells, suggesting that ethylene promotes cell division and growth in developing gemmae. By contrast, ACC treatment inhibits gemma growth and development by suppressing cell division, even in the Mpein3-knockout alleles. Knockout mutants of one or both ACC SYNTHASE (ACS) gene homologues produce negligible levels of ACC, have more and larger gemma cups, and have more-expanded thallus branches. Mpacs2 and Mpacs1 Mpacs2 gemmae also display a high frequency of abnormal apical notches (meristems) that are not observed in ethylene mutants. These findings reveal that ethylene and ACC have distinct functions, and suggest that ACC is a signalling molecule in Marchantia. ACC may be an evolutionarily conserved signal that predates its efficient conversion to ethylene in higher plants.","[Li, Dongdong; Ahtesham, Uzair; Coleman, Andrew; Clay, John M.; Chang, Caren] Univ Maryland, Dept Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Flores-Sandoval, Eduardo; Bowman, John L.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Chang, CR (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Bowman, JL (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",Australia,Oceania,Global North,john.bowman@monash.edu; carenc@umd.edu,,"Bowman, John/0000-0001-7347-3691; Chang, Caren/0000-0003-0384-5888; Li, Dongdong/0000-0001-7464-6478; Flores-Sandoval, Eduardo/0000-0002-4656-2522",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1714993]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170100049]; China Scholarship Council graduate student fellowshipChina Scholarship Council; Howard Hughes Medical Institute through the Science Education Program; Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station,"We thank Y.-T.

However, plant pathogens also are capable of producing ethylene, and ethylene might have an effect not only on the plant but on the pathogen as well. Therefore, ethylene may play a dual role in fungus-plant interactions by affecting the plant as well as the pathogen. To address this question, we studied the effects of ethylene on the gray mold fungus Botrytis cinerea and the disease it causes on Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Exposure of B. cinerea to ethylene inhibited mycellium growth in vitro and caused transcriptional changes in a large number of fungal genes. A screen of fungal signaling mutants revealed a G alpha null mutant (Delta bcg1) which was ethylene insensitive, overproduced ethylene in vitro, and showed considerable transcriptional changes in response to ethylene compared with the wild type. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG)-treated, ethylene-nonproducing N. benthamiana plants developed much larger necroses than ethylene-producing plants, whereas addition of ethylene to AVG-treated leaves restricted disease spreading. Ethylene also affected fungal gene expression in planta. Expression of a putative pathogenicity fungal gene, bcspl1, was enhanced 24 h after inoculation in ethylene-producing plants but only 48 h after inoculation in ethylene-nonproducing plants. Our results show that the responses of B. cinerea to ethylene are partly mediated by a G protein signaling pathway, and that ethylene-induced plant resistance might involve effects of plant ethylene on both the plant and the fungus.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Plant Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Univ Munster, Inst Bot Westf, D-48149 Munster, Germany",,"Sharon, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Plant Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",Israel,Middle east,Global North,amirsh@tauex.tau.ac.il,"Siewers, Verena/AAV-4902-2020","Siewers, Verena/0000-0002-9502-9804; Schulze Gronover, Christian/0000-0001-6398-2265",,,41,78,AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC,ST PAUL,"3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA",0894-0282,1943-7706,JAN,2006,19,1,10.1094/MPMI-19-0033,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Plant Sciences,995KQ,WOS:000234099600004,16404951,hybrid,

The extent of these post-harvest problems varies markedly for bananas grown in lowland areas, in contrast with those grown in the highlands. These quality problems are common during the second half of the year, when the fruit develops during the hot wet season. An experiment was carried out in areas with differing soils and climate, through two seasons with different rainfall patterns. The results showed that in the wet season, lowland fruit was mechanically more fragile and produced more wound ethylene than highland fruit (about 1850 nl/kg for lowland bananas, and 1000 nl/kg for highland bananas). The malic acid concentration of the fruit was quite closely correlated with this wound ethylene production, especially in fruit grown at low elevation (r = 0.80). However, there was no correlation between the ACC concentration of the fruit and wound ethylene production. On the other hand, there was a weak correlation between the Mn concentration and wound ethylene production in lowland bananas. These results indicate that climatic conditions during fruit growth has an important influence on fruit quality and post-harvest physiology.

It is well documented that fruit ripening is developmentally regulated and affected by environmental factors such as temperature and light. Blue light has been shown to induce pigment synthesis in postharvest fruit. However, information on its effect on fruit ripening is still limited. This study aimed to investigate the effect of light-emitting diode blue light treatment at 40 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) on fruit ripening, ethylene biosynthesis and signalling in postharvest peaches during storage at 10 degrees C. Blue light exposure induced fruit ripening as expressed by the enhanced decline of fruit firmness and increases in skin colour parameters, which was associated with the increase in ethylene production because of the up-regulated expression of PpLOXs and ethylene biosynthetic genes such as PpACO1 and PpACS3. Meanwhile, six genes in relation to ethylene perception and signalling were also investigated using real-time PCR. Among them, blue light treatment significantly inhibited expression of PpERS1 and enhanced transcript levels of PpEIN2, PpEIL1, PpEIL2 and PpERF2, which led to an induction ethylene signalling pathway and resulted in turn into the promotion of ethylene production and fruit softening in postharvest peaches. Compared to control fruit stored at darkness, higher expression level of ethylene biosynthetic and signalling genes in blue light exposed peaches could be beneficial for its ethylene production and consequently fruit ripening.

In order to better understand the rote of ABA in ripening and senescence of these two types of fruits, we cloned the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) gene that encodes a key enzyme in ABA biosynthesis from peaches and grapes using an RT-PCR approach. The NCED gene fragments were cloned from peaches (PpNCED1and PpNCED2, each 740bp) and grapes (VVNCED1, 741 bp) using degenerate primers designed based on the conserved amino acids sequence of NCEDs in other plants. PpNCED1 showed 78.54% homology with PpNCED2, 74.90% homology with VVNCED1, and both showed high homology to NCEDs from other plants. The expression patterns of PpNCED1 and VVNCED1 were very similar. Both were highly expressed at the beginning of ripening when ABA content becomes high. The maximum ABA preceded ethylene production in peach fruit. ABA in the grape gradually increased from the beginning of ripening and reached the highest level at 20d before the harvest stage. However, ethylene remained at tow levels during the entire process of fruit development, including ripening and senescence. ABA content, and ripening and softening of both types of fruits, were promoted or delayed by exogenous ABA or Fluridone (or NDGA) treatment. The rotes of ABA and ethylene in the later ripening of fruit are complex. Based on results obtained in this study, we concluded that PpNCED1 and VVNCED1 initiate ABA biosynthesis at the beginning of fruit ripening, and that ABA accumulation might play a key role in the regulation of ripeness and senescence of both peach and grape fruits.

OsPLS3regulates the onset of leaf senescence in rice.AbstractGlycosyltransferases (GTs) are one of the most important enzyme groups required for the modification of plant secondary metabolites and play a crucial role in plant growth and development, however the biological functions of most GTs remain elusive. We reported here the identification and characterization of a novel Oryza sativa premature leaf senescence mutant (ospls3). Through map-based cloning strategy, we determined that 22-bp deletion in the OsPLS3 gene encoding a domain of unknown function 266 (DUF266)-containing protein, a member of GT14-like, underlies the premature leaf senescence phenotype in the ospls3 mutant. The OsPLS3 mRNA levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in wild-type rice, implying a negative role of OsPLS3 in regulating leaf senescence. Physiological analysis, and histochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy assays indicated that the ospls3 mutant accumulated higher levels of ethylene and reactive oxygen species than its wild type. Furthermore, the ospls3 mutant showed hypersensitivity to exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, H2O2 and high level of cytokinins. Our results indicated that the DUF266-containing gene OsPLS3 plays an important role in the onset of leaf senescence, in part through cytokinin and ethylene signaling in rice.","[Li, Kunyu; Chen, Yaodong; Luo, Yanmin; Zhao, Chaoyue; Cheng, Fangmin; Pan, Gang] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Agron, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Fudeng] Zhejiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crop & Nucl Technol Utilizat, Hangzhou 310021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Xun] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Agr & Biotechnol, Expt Teaching Ctr, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Pan, G (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Agron, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,pangang12@zju.edu.cn,,"pan, gang/0000-0003-4894-648X",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFD0300100]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31771688]; National Key Transform Program [2016ZX08001-002],"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFD0300100), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31771688) and the National Key Transform Program (2016ZX08001-002).

Given the chemical diversity of all these molecules, it could be deduced that Se may act as a dormancy-breaking agent of Townsville stylo seeds. Se-stimulated seeds produced great amounts of both ethylene and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, which correlated with the process of germination. As specific inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and action largely depressed this Se-stimulated germination, it was concluded that Se broke dormancy by triggering ethylene production by the seeds.","[Barros, Raimundo Santos; Coelho, Tales Graciano; de Lana Souza, Braulio Maia] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Vegetal, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil",,"Barros, RS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Vegetal, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",Brazil,South America,Global South,rsbarros@ufv.br,,,,,,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0960-2585,1475-2735,MAR,2008,18,1,10.1017/S0960258508890253,Plant Sciences,,Plant Sciences,,Green Published,

Treatments included: 1) AVG alone; 2) AVG followed by ethephon; 3) ethephon alone; and 4) control. Silwet L-77 surfactant was included in all treatments. Application of AVG delayed the onset of the ethylene climacteric and red color development of both cultivars. Application of AVG followed by ethephon similarly delayed the onset of the ethylene climacteric, but red color development at the commercial harvest date was only marginally reduced or not affected. The results were similar in both 1998 and 1999, although environmental stress during the growing seasons differed (1998-heat; 1999-moderate temperatures). The delay of fruit maturation and ripening observed at harvest following AVG +/- ethephon treatments improved storability of fruit in controlled atmosphere (CA) storage, as demonstrated by low internal ethylene levels after storage, and high retention of flesh firmness and shelf-life, while control fruit and those treated only with ethephon entered the ethylene climacteric during storage, and flesh firmness subsequently declined during shelf-life evaluation.

During climacteric ripening of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Bonaparte'), ethylene production rises considerably which makes it an ideal object to study SAM involvement. We examined in ripening fruit how a 1-MCP treatment affects SAM usage by the three major SAM-associated pathways. The 1-MCP treatment inhibited autocatalytic ethylene production but did not affect SAM levels. We also observed that 1-(malonylamino)cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid formation during ripening is ethylene dependent. SAM decarboxylase expression was also found to be upregulated by ethylene. Nonetheless polyamine content was higher in 1-MCP-treated fruit. This leads to the conclusion that the ethylene and polyamine pathway can operate simultaneously. We also observed a higher methylation capacity in 1-MCP-treated fruit. During fruit ripening substantial methylation reactions occur which are gradually inhibited by the methylation product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH). SAH accumulation is caused by a drop in adenosine kinase expression, which is not observed in 1-MCP-treated fruit. We can conclude that tomato fruit possesses the capability to simultaneously consume SAM during ripening to ensure a high rate of ethylene and polyamine production and transmethylation reactions. SAM usage during ripening requires a complex cellular regulation mechanism in order to control SAM levels.","[Van de Poel, Bram; Bulens, Inge; Hertog, Marten L. A. T.

When plants were root treated with 0.5 mM IAA, shoot epinasty and inhibition of root and shoot growth developed during 24 h. Concomitantly, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase activity, and ACC and ethylene production were transiently stimulated in the shoot tissue within 2 h, followed by increases in immunoreactive (+)-abscisic acid (ABA) and its precursor xanthoxal (xanthoxin) after 5 h. After 24 h of treatment, levels of xanthoxal and ABA were elevated up to 2- and 24-fold, relative to control, respectively. In plants treated with IAA, 7-chloro-3-methyl-8-quinolinecarboxylic acid, naphthalene acetic acid, 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid, and 4-amino-3, 6,6-trichloropicolinic acid, levels of ethylene, ACC, and ABA increased in close correlation with inhibition of shoot growth. Aminoethoxyvinyl-glycine and cobalt ions, which inhibit ethylene synthesis, decreased ABA accumulation and growth inhibition, whereas the ethylene-releasing ethephon promoted ABA levels and growth inhibition. In accordance, tomato mutants defective in ethylene perception (never ripe) did not produce the xanthoxal and ABA increases and growth inhibition induced by auxins in wild-type plants. This suggests that auxin-stimulated ethylene triggers ABA accumulation and the consequent growth inhibition. Reduced catabolism most probably did not contribute to ABA increase, as indicated by immunoanalyses of ABA degradation and conjugation products in shoot. tissue and by pulse experiments with [H-3]-ABA in cell suspensions of G. aparine. In contrast, studies using inhibitors of ABA biosynthesis (fluridone, naproxen, and tungstate), ABA-deficient tomato mutants (notabilis, flacca, and sitiens), and quantification of xanthophylls indicate that ABA biosynthesis is influenced, probably through stimulated cleavage of xanthophylls to xanthoxal in shoot tissue.","BASF AG, Agr Ctr Limburgerhof, D-67114 Limburgerhof, Germany",,"Grossmann, K (corresponding author), BASF AG, Agr Ctr Limburgerhof, D-67114 Limburgerhof, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,klaus.grossmann@basf-ag.de,,,,,46,279,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,NOV,2000,124,3,10.1104/pp.124.3.1437,Plant Sciences,374VV,WOS:000165365800050,11080318,"Bronze, Green Published",

For huanglongbing (HLB)-affected orange trees, the fruit may never turn orange during the entire harvest season, despite any cold weather. Improvement of early season citrus peel color is important to the citrus industry to better meet consumer expectations. Occasionally, packinghouses apply a dye, Citrus Red No. 2 (CR2), to improve the surface color of oranges, temples, and tangelos before applying a fruit wax to impart shine, retain moisture, and slow fruit senescence. In a previous report, we determined that paprika and annatto extracts are comparable to CR2 as natural colorant alternatives. In this research, the goal was to formulate a natural colorant [annatto, paprika, or paprika oleoresin (PO)]-containing carnauba wax coating. The coatings were first evaluated for color, shine, moisture retention, respiration rate, ethylene production, and internal gas content. Control fruit were coated with carnauba wax alone, or dyed with CR2 then coated with carnauba wax. The effects were assessed under different temperature and light exposure conditions to simulate commercial storage and marketing. The results showed that a one-step application of paprika-containing carnauba wax was comparable to the two-step (CR2 then wax'') applications in improving fruit appearance and modification of internal gas composition.","[Sun, Xiuxiu; Baldwin, Elizabeth; Hagenmaier, Robert; Bai, Jinhe] ARS, US Hort Res Lab, USDA, 2001 South Rock Rd, Ft Pierce, FL 34945 USA; [Sun, Xiuxiu; Ritenour, Mark] Univ Florida, Indian River Res & Educ Ctr, 2199 South Rock Rd, Ft Pierce, FL 34845 USA",,"Bai, JH (corresponding author), ARS, US Hort Res Lab, USDA, 2001 South Rock Rd, Ft Pierce, FL 34945 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,jinhe.bai@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,4,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,MAR,2017,52,3,10.21273/HORTSCI11534-16,Horticulture,,Agriculture,,gold,

As a starting point to investigate this effect, the Arabidopsis accession Landsberg erecta (Ler) got into focus as it was found defective in metabolizing D-AAs. Combining genetics and molecular biology of T-DNA insertion lines and natural variants together with biochemical and physiological approaches, we could identify AtDAT1 as a major D-AA transaminase in Arabidopsis. Atdat1 loss-of-function mutants and Arabidopsis accessions with defective AtDAT1 alleles were unable to produce the metabolites of D-Met, D-Ala, D-Glu, and L-Met. This result corroborates the biochemical characterization, which showed highest activity of AtDAT1 using D-Met as a substrate. Germination of seedlings in light and dark led to enhanced growth inhibition of atdat1 mutants on D-Met. Ethylene measurements revealed an increased D-AA stimulated ethylene production in these mutants. According to initial working models of this phenomenon, D-Met is preferentially malonylated instead of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). This decrease of ACC degradation should then lead to the increase of ethylene production. We could observe a reciprocal relation of malonylated methionine and ACC upon D-Met application and significantly more malonyl-methionine in atdat1 mutants. Unexpectedly, the malonyl-ACC levels did not differ between mutants and wild type. With AtDAT1, the first central enzyme of plant D-AA metabolism was characterized biochemically and physiologically. The specific effects of D-Met on ACC metabolism, ethylene production, and plant development of dat1 mutants unraveled the impact of AtDAT1 on these processes; however, they are not in full accordance to previous working models. Instead, our results imply the influence of additional factors or processes on D-AA-stimulated ethylene production, which await to be uncovered.","[Suarez, Juan; Hener, Claudia; Lehnhardt, Vivien-Alisa; Hummel, Sabine; Stahl, Mark; Kolukisaoglu, Uener] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Plant Mol Biol ZMBP, Tubingen, Germany",,"Kolukisaoglu, U (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Ctr Plant Mol Biol ZMBP, Tubingen, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,uener.koluldsaoglu@uni-tuebingen.de,,,Deutscher Akademischer AustauschdienstDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [DAAD 91567028]; University of Tubingen,JS was supported by the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD 91567028).

The roles of conditioning period, CO2 and a strigol analogue (GR24) in ethylene biosynthesis and germination of the parasite were investigated, Conditioning increased the seeds' capacity to oxidize exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), Exogenous CO2 increased the seeds capacity to oxidize ACC by 3- to 9-fold, A combination of GR24 and ACC increased ethylene production by more than 3-foId in comparison with the rates obtained using these compounds separately. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) completely inhibited ethylene induction by GR24, but not by ACC. A GR24 treatment, made subsequent to conditioning in GR24, did not induce ethylene. However, seeds conditioned in GR24 and then given 1 mM ACC produced 293 nl l(-1) ethylene, ACC oxidase (ACCO) activity in crude extracts was increased by conditioning and CO2. The enzyme displayed an absolute requirement for ascorbate. Absence of exogenous Fe2+ reduced enzyme activity only by 14%, GR24 applied during conditioning reduced germination in response to a subsequent GR24 treatment, ACC was, invariably, less effective in inducing S, hermonthica germination than GR24 even at concentrations which induce more ethylene than concurrent GR24 treatments. The results are consistent with a model in which conditioning removes a restriction on the ethylene biosynthetic pathway in S. hermonthica seeds. GR24 modulates the key enzymes in ethylene biosynthesis. The stimulant suppresses ethylene biosynthesis in unconditioned seeds and promotes it in conditioned ones. Germination of S, hermonthica results from the joint action of GR24 and the ethylene it induces.","Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan; Agr Res Corp, Wad Medani, Sudan",,"Sugimoto, Y (corresponding author), Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, 1390 Hamasaka, Tottori 6800001, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,,"Ma, Yongqing/M-5616-2017","Ma, Yongqing/0000-0001-7525-9111",,,32,21,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0031-9317,,MAY,2000,109,1,10.1034/j.1399-3054.2000.100111.x,Plant Sciences,318HE,WOS:000087277200011,,,

In Nr tomato, the ethylene perception was blocked. When both materials were treated with calcium, the content of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)/malonyl-ACC and the activity of ACC oxidase (ACO) in tomato fruit discs increased, whereas the production of ethylene, content of malondialdehyde, and membrane permeability decreased. Calcium treatment did not affect the activity of ACC synthase, which is the first committed step in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway. The expression of LeACO1 in mature green fruit was inhibited significantly by calcium treatment in wild-type and Nr tomatoes, but the expression of LeACS2, the key ACC synthase gene in ethylene synthesis during tomato fruit maturing, was not affected. These results revealed that the effect of calcium on ethylene biosynthesis in tomato mature green fruit was independent of ethylene perception. The results also revealed that the targeting step of calcium preventing ethylene production was located at the ACC conversion to ethylene, by means of inhibiting ACC availability for ACO through enhancing cell membrane integrity and by means of preventing LeACO1 gene expression.","China Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Nutr Engn, Beijing 10083, Peoples R China; Beijing Univ Chem & Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Beijing 10029, Peoples R China; China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Dept Microbiol, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",,"Wang, WY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Nutr Engn, Beijing 10083, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,lyb@cau.edu.cn,"zhu, benzhong/G-6628-2011",,,,,5,PLEIADES PUBLISHING INC,MOSCOW,"PLEIADES PUBLISHING INC, MOSCOW, 00000, RUSSIA",1021-4437,1608-3407,JAN-FEB,2006,53,1,10.1134/S1021443706010079,Plant Sciences,,Plant Sciences,,,

Ethylene influences interactions between the gray mold pathogen, Botrytis cinerea, and its hosts. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of ethylene on gray mold susceptibility of pear fruits. B. cinerea induced ethylene emission from infected pear fruits. As expected, ethylene production and softening of pear fruits were accelerated by propylene and inhibited by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), but these chemical treatments had a relatively small effect on the rate of lesion expansion after wound inoculation with B. cinerea. Cotreatment of pear fruits with 1-MCP and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) delayed the onset of ethylene emission well beyond the onset of lesion expansion. The trace amount of ethylene produced after inhibition with AVG and 1-MCP was at least partially produced via Iaminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. Gray mold susceptibility was cultivar-dependent; d'Anjou pears were more susceptible than Bartlett fruits. Storage enhanced the susceptibility of pear fruits. Virulence of the B. cinerea strain B05.10 on pear fruits was dependent on the polygalacturonase gene Bcpg1, but not on the pectin methylesterase gene Bcpme1. Thus, we conclude that, unlike exogenous manipulation of ethylene and associated changes in fruit softening, pectin catabolism plays a major role in gray mold susceptibility of pear.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Hort, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"Stotz, HU (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Hort, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,stotzhe@hort.oregonstate.edu,,"Stotz, Henrik/0000-0003-2954-8566",,,44,17,AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC,ST PAUL,"3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA",0191-2917,1943-7692,OCT,2007,91,10,10.1094/PDIS-91-10-1337,Plant Sciences,210VT,WOS:000249484400019,30780514,hybrid,

Together with real-time quantitative PCR validation, the results showed that treatment with 200 mM NaCl depressed expression levels of genes for photosynthesis and aquaporins, suggesting that saline stress might inhibit photosynthesis and water uptake. However, expression levels of aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase, bifunctional L-3-cyanoalanine synthase/cysteine synthase and cyanoalanine synthase increased, suggesting elevation of ethylene production, which were further transduced by ethylene-responsive receptor and ethylene-insensitive 3 transcription factor. Metabolome analyses detected higher contents of pyrophosphate, D-galacturonic acid and elaidic acid in treatment with 200 mM NaCl than those in the control. These changes should positively regulate glycolysis, energy supply and integrity of cell membrane.

There is a close relation between ethylene production and seedling growth of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), yet the exact function of ethylene during this early developmental stage is still unclear. While ethylene is mostly considered to be a root growth inhibitor, we found that external 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) regulates root growth in sugar beet in a concentration-dependent manner: low concentrations stimulate root growth while high concentrations inhibit root growth. These results reveal that ethylene action during root elongation is strongly concentration dependent. Furthermore our detailed study of ethylene biosynthesis kinetics revealed a very strict gene regulation pattern of ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO), in which ACS is the rate liming step during sugar beet seedling development.","[Abts, Willem; De Proft, Maurice P.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Crop Biotech, Dept Biosyst, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Van de Poel, Bram] Univ Maryland, Dept Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Vandenbussche, Bert] SESVanderHave NV, B-3300 Tienen, Belgium",,"Abts, W (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Crop Biotech, Dept Biosyst, Willem de Croylaan 42,Bus 2427, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",Belgium,Europe,Global North,willem.abts@biw.kuleuven.be,"Van de Poel, Bram/N-1774-2015","Van de Poel, Bram/0000-0001-5638-2472","Department of Biosystems, University of Leuven; Belgian American Educational Foundation","This research and the position of WA are funded by the Department of Biosystems, University of Leuven, which is gratefully acknowledged.

Benth., an important root parasitic weed on poaceous crops, was investigated at the physiological and molecular levels. Seeds, conditioned at 30degreesC for 14 days, were treated with ethylene, ethephon or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). Ethylene consistently induced low germination. Ethephon and ACC effectively stimulated germination at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 mM, respectively. In contrast to ethylene, both ethephon and ACC acted in a concentration-dependent manner. Germination induced by the synthetic strigolactone GR24 was inhibited by aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) and 1-methylcyclopropene. ACC reversed the inhibition caused by AVG. When seeds were treated with GR24 in sealed vials, ethylene concentration in headspace gas increased prior to the onset of germination. Total RNA extracted from germinating seeds 12 h after GR24 treatment was used for PCR-based amplification of cDNA fragments encoding the ACC synthase- and oxidase-active site domains. Two distinct cDNA fragments encoding ACC synthase (SHACS1 and SHACS2) and one encoding ACC oxidase (SHACO1) were cloned and sequenced. Southern analysis suggested that each of the cloned genes was present as a single copy in the genome of S. hermonthica. Northern analyses showed that SHACS1 exhibited a temporal change in expression peaking at 10 h after GR24 treatment, which coincided with a steady increase in ethylene concentration. SHACS2 was expressed at a low level with a similar trend. SHACO1 exhibited a temporal change in expression peaking at 15 days during conditioning, when seed response to GR24 was maximal. In summary, expression of ACC synthase and ACC oxidase genes was found to be responsive to a germination stimulant and to conditioning, respectively. The implications of these findings with respect to germination of S. hermonthica under field conditions are discussed.","Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan; Tottori Univ, Fac Agr, Tottori 6808553, Japan",,"Sugimoto, Y (corresponding author), Kobe Univ, Fac Agr, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,yukihiro@kobe-u.ac.jp,,,,,24,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-9317,1399-3054,SEP,2003,119,1,10.1034/j.1399-3054.2003.00162.x,Plant Sciences,717FX,WOS:000185077100017,,,

These included the period of induction and subculture of callus, and 3- and 7-day suspension cultures for the induction of somatic embryogenesis. The polyamines contained in the embryogenic callus were found to include putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm), but the level of Spm was much less than that of Put and Spd. There was a dramatic increase in MACC after induction of embryogenesis, and ACC levels were lower in somatic embryos than in embryogenic callus. Induction of embryogenesis for 3 days increased the levels of ACC and polyamines to a maximum level, and these then reduced as the embryogenesis proceeded. The ratios of Put/Spd and ACC/MACC were decreased during the induction. This indicated that both high levels of ACC and polyamines might be a prerequisite for early differentiation during the induction of the embryogenesis. Thus, there appears not to be competition between polyamine biosynthesis and ethylene biosynthesis at least during the induction of somatic embryogenesis, because both the polyamines and ACC were simultaneously increased during the induction period. Conversion of ACC into MACC and the maintenance of a relatively high level of polyamines, especially Spd, appear to be important for further development of the embryos. When aminooxylvinylglycine (AOA) was added at the initiation of the callus subculture, it had no significant effect on the callus growth, the ethylene production and ACC level of the callus. However, AOA increased the numbers of the embryos accompanying an increase in Spd level and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) activity. Thus, the AOA effect could be associated with Spd increase rather than with the effect of ethylene biosynthesis.","Zhongshan Univ, Dept Biol, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China",,"Huang, XL (corresponding author), Zhongshan Univ, Dept Biol, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,ls17@zsu.edu.cn,,,,,45,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-9317,1399-3054,NOV,2001,113,3,10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1130317.x,Plant Sciences,493HT,WOS:000172217100017,12060289,,

The expression of MdARF5, a member of the auxin response factor transcription factor (TF) family involved in the auxin signaling pathway, was enhanced by treatment with the synthetic auxin naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Further studies revealed that MdARF5 binds to the promoter of MdERF2, encoding a TF in the ethylene signaling pathway, as well as the promoters of two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) genes (MdACS3a and MdACS1) and an ACC oxidase (ACO) gene, MdACO1, all of which encode key steps in ethylene biosynthesis, thereby inducing their expression.

Two potential targets of ABA action in a pollen tube (PT) are identified. These are represented by (1) plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase, electrogenic proton pump participating in PM polarization, and (2) Ca-dependent K+-channels localized in the same membrane. It was established that a stimulatory effect of ABA on electrogenic activity of H+-ATPase is mediated by the increase in free Ca2+ level in the cytosol of a PT and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Based on the results obtained on the role of K+ ions in the hormonal control of water transport-driving forces in a PT, the hypothesis suggesting that ABA stimulated pollen grains (PGs) germinating and PT growth by activating K+-channels was put forward. The revealed ABA-induced shift in cytoplasmic pH (pH(c)) is suggested to be involved in a cascade of the events of the progamic phase of fertilization, including pH-dependent K+-channels functioning. It was established that ABA abolishes the inhibitory effects of ethylene receptors blocker, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), and blockers of ACC and ABA synthesis (aminooxyacetic acid, AOA, and fluridone, respectively) on PT germination and growth, whereas ethrel blocks the inhibitory effect of fluridone on PT growth. In stigmas pretreated with ABA and AOA before pollination, this phytohormone was found to suppress inhibitory effect of AOA on ACC synthesis in the pollen-pistil system. All these findings, taken together, led us to the conclusion that ABA is involved in petunia male gametophyte osmoregulation interacting with ethylene at the level of ACC synthesis in the progamic phase of fertilization.","[Kovaleva, L.

In this study, we have characterized two genes encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS; EC 2.2.1.7) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductase (DXR; EC 1.1.1.267) enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. The full-length cDNAs of W. somnifera DXS (WsDXS) and DXR (WsDXR) of 2,154 and 1,428 bps encode polypeptides of 717 and 475 amino acids residues, respectively. The expression analysis suggests that WsDXS and WsDXR are differentially expressed in different tissues (with maximal expression in flower and young leaf), chemotypes of Withania, and in response to salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, as well as in mechanical injury. Analysis of genomic organization of WsDXS shows close similarity with tomato DXS in terms of exon-intron arrangements. This is the first report on characterization of isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway genes from Withania.","[Gupta, Parul; Agarwal, Aditya Vikram; Akhtar, Nehal; Trivedi, Prabodh Kumar] CSIR, Natl Bot Res Inst, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sangwan, Rajender Singh] CSIR, Cent Inst Med & Aromat Plants, Lucknow 226015, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Surya Pratap] Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Trivedi, PK (corresponding author), CSIR, Natl Bot Res Inst, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",India,Asia,Global South,prabodht@hotmail.com,"AGARWAL, ADITYA VIKRAM/E-9694-2019","AGARWAL, ADITYA VIKRAM/0000-0001-9260-0799; Singh, Surya/0000-0001-5668-1712; Sangwan, Rajender Singh/0000-0003-1708-4151","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, Govt. of India under NMITLI [NWP-08]","The authors are thankful to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, Govt. of India, for providing the financial support to carry out this work under NMITLI scheme and Network Project (NWP-08).

Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMP) augments SGs production, though the effect of this interaction on SGs biosynthesis has not been studied at molecular level. In this study transcription profiles of eleven key genes grouped under three stages of the SGs biosynthesis pathway were compared. The transcript analysis showed upregulation of genes encoding 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway enzymes viz.,1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phospate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phospate reductoisomerase (DXR) and 2-C-methyl-D-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS) in mycorrhizal (M) plants. Zn and Mn are imperative for the expression of MDS and their enhanced uptake in M plants could be responsible for the increased transcription of MDS. Furthermore, in the second stage of SGs biosynthesis pathway, mycorrhization enhanced the transcription of copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPPS) and kaurenoic acid hydroxylase (KAH). Their expression is decisive for SGs biosynthesis as CPPS regulates flow of metabolites towards synthesis of kaurenoid precursors and KAH directs these towards steviol synthesis instead of gibberellins. In the third stage glucosylation of steviol to reb-A by four specific uridine diphosphate (UDP)-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) occurs. While higher transcription of all the three characterized UGTs in M plants explains augmented production of SGs; higher transcript levels of UGT76G1, specifically improved reb-A to stev ratio implying increased sweetness. The work signifies that AM symbiosis upregulates the transcription of all eleven SGs biosynthesis genes as a result of improved nutrition and enhanced sugar concentration due to increased photosynthesis in M plants.

Isoprene emission is strongly induced by the increase in isoprene synthase activity in plastids at high temperature in the day time, which is regulated at its gene expression level in leaves, while the physiological meaning of isoprene emission for plants has not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, we have functionally overexpressed Populus alba isoprene synthase in Arabidopsis to observe isoprene emission from transgenic plants. A striking difference was observed when both transgenic and wild-type plants were treated with heat at 60 degrees C for 2.5 h, i.e. transformants revealed clear heat tolerance compared with the wild type. High isoprene emission and a decrease in the leaf surface temperature were observed in transgenic plants under heat stress treatment. In contrast, neither strong light nor drought treatments showed an apparent difference. These data suggest that isoprene emission plays a crucial role in a heat protection mechanism in plants.","Kyoto Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Humanosphere, Lab Plant Gene Express, Uji 6110011, Japan; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo 02044, Finland; RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan",,"Yazaki, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Humanosphere, Lab Plant Gene Express, Uji 6110011, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,yazaki@rish.kyoto.ac.jp,"Saito, Takuya/E-5877-2010; Muranaka, Toshiya/D-4351-2016","Muranaka, Toshiya/0000-0003-1058-2473; Oksman-Caldentey, Kirsi-Marja/0000-0003-2830-165X",,,37,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,,SEP,2007,48,9,10.1093/pcp/pcm104,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,220LQ,WOS:000250158600002,17711876,Bronze,

The multi-copy nature of IDS gene in a gymnosperm Ginkgo biloba is known. To evaluate the function of each isogene, the roles of the promoters were examined in Arabidopsis model. Among the promoters of GbIDS series, about 1.3 kb of GbIDS1pro and 1.5 kb of GbIDS2pro were cloned and fused with GUS. The GbIDS1pro::GUS was introduced into Arabidopsis to show GUS expression in most organs except for roots, petals, and stamina, whereas the GbIDS2pro::GUS was expressed only in the young leaves, internodes where the flower and shoot branched, and notably in primary root junction. This pattern of GUS expression correlated with high transcript level of GbIDS2 compared to that of GbIDS1 in Ginkgo roots. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment resulted in down-regulated GbIDS1pro activity in Arabidopsis leaves and upregulated GbIDS2pro activity in roots. The same pattern of gene regulation in roots was also seen upon treatments of gibberellins, abscisic acid, and indole butyric acid. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Carotenoids and the phytyl side chain of chlorophylls are isoprenoids derived from the plastid nonMVA pathway. All enzymes involved in the nonMVA pathway have been identified in Escherichia coli. The E. coli IspF protein catalyzes a unique cyclization reaction to convert 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphate into 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate in the nonMVA pathway. We have characterized an Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant, ispF-1, which has a null mutation in the IspF gene. Homozygous ispF-1 mutants are albino lethal and the IspF transcripts are undetectable in these plants. Moreover, the ispF-1 mutant chloroplasts are filled with vesicles instead of thylakoids. Amino acid sequence alignment reveals that the IspF proteins are highly conserved between plants and bacteria. Interestingly, expression of the Arabidopsis IspF protein can rescue the lethal phenotype of an E. coli ispF Mutant. These results indicate that the Arabidopsis IspF may share similar enzymatic mechanisms with the E. coli protein.","Acad Sinica, Inst Plant & Microbial Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,"Hsieh, MH (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Plant & Microbial Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",Taiwan,Asia,Global North,ming@gate.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,41,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0032-0935,1432-2048,MAR,2006,223,4,10.1007/s00425-005-0140-9,Plant Sciences,034YA,WOS:000236965600015,16231155,Closed,Closed

Southern blotting and genotyping analysis revealed that two NtDXR genes existed in the tetraploid tobacco genome; NtDXR1 and NtDXR2 were separately derived from N. tomentosiformis and N. sylvestris. Both NtDXRs were localized in chloroplasts. Expression patterns indicated that NtDXR1 and NtDXR2 had similar expression profiles. NtDXR genes were highly expressed in leaves with or without trichomes; expression was relatively reduced in inot sign,owers and stems, weak in leaf trichomes and marginal in roots and seeds. Overexpressing NtDXR1 under control of the 35S promoter resulted in longer primary roots and enhancement of various photosynthetic pigments and hormones in leaves. In contrast, there were no significant changes in cembrane-related diterpenoids synthesized in glandular trichomes. To elucidate further the function of DXR in the biosynthesis of diterpenoids, overexpression vectors for NtDXR1 under the control of a trichome-specific CYP promoter were transferred to tobacco plants. CYP:NtDXR1 tobacco exhibited larger glandular cells and increased cembrane-related diterpenoids in leaf glandular trichomes. Moreover, transcripts of eight MEP (2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate) pathway genes were significantly up-regulated in NtDXR1-overexpressing tobacco plants, indicating that overexpression of NtDXR could boost the expression of downstream genes in the MEP pathway. Our results suggested that overexpression of NtDXR1 could increase the levels of photosynthetic pigments, leaf surface exudates and hormones though the MEP pathway.","[Zhang, Hongying; Niu, Dexin; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Songtao; Yang, Yongxia; Jia, Hongfang; Cui, Hong] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Tobacco Sci, Key Lab Cultivat Tobacco Ind, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China",,"Cui, H (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Tobacco Sci, Key Lab Cultivat Tobacco Ind, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,cuihonger_13@163.com,,,"State Tobacco Monopoly Administration of China [110201401003 (JY-03), Ts-01-2011004 (JY-03)]",This work was supported by the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration of China [grant Nos. 110201401003 (JY-03) and Ts-01-2011004 (JY-03)].,52,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,1471-9053,NOV,2015,56,11,10.1093/pcp/pcv131,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,CZ6CY,WOS:000367190000005,26363359,Bronze,

We have identified an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant that survives an otherwise lethal block of the MEP pathway with fosmidomycin (FSM). In rif10 (resistant to inhibition with FSM 10) plants, the accumulation of flux-controlling enzymes of the pathway is posttranscriptionally up-regulated. Strikingly, this phenotype is linked to a lower accumulation of plastidial isoprenoid pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids, resulting in mutant plants that are paler and smaller than the wild type. The rif10 mutant is impaired in plastid RNA processing due to a T-DNA insertion in the coding region of the At3g03710 gene encoding the chloroplast-targeted exoribonuclease polyribonucleotide phosphorylase. FSM resistance and other rif10-like phenotypes were also observed in wild-type Arabidopsis, tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), and rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings grown in the presence of sublethal concentrations of chloramphenicol (an inhibitor of protein synthesis in plastids). By contrast, treatment with norflurazon (an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis causing a similar pale cotyledon phenotype) did not result in FSM resistance. Together, the results support that plastome-encoded proteins are involved in negatively regulating the posttranscriptional accumulation of specific nuclear-encoded MEP pathway enzymes in chloroplasts. Regulation of the MEP pathway by a mechanism dependent on plastid cues might function under physiological conditions to finely adjust plastidial isoprenoid biosynthesis to the metabolic capabilities or requirements of plastids.","Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; CSIC, Inst Catalana Rec Estudis Avancats Consorci, Cient Inst Rec Tecnol Agroalimentaries, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Biol Mol Plantas, Inst Biotecnol, Cuernavaca 62271, Morelos, Mexico",,"Rodriguez-Concepcion, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,mrodrigu@sun.bq.ub.es,"Martinez-Garcia, Jaime F/H-6868-2015; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/I-7229-2015","Martinez-Garcia, Jaime F/0000-0003-1516-0341; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/0000-0002-1280-2305; Flores-Perez, Ursula/0000-0002-6780-3671",ICREAICREA Funding Source: Custom,,43,67,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,MAY,2006,141,1,10.1104/pp.106.079855,Plant Sciences,040VR,WOS:000237409400007,16531478,"Bronze, Green Published",

Promising cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activities have been reported for these compounds in various cell and animal models. We have recently shown that aethiopinone, an o-naphto-quinone diterpene, produced in the roots of different Salvia species, is selectively cytotoxic against the A375 melanoma cell line. To enhance the synthesis of this abietane diterpenoid, we have engineered the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate-derived isoprenoid pathway in Salvia sclarea hairy roots by ectopic expression and plastid targeting of cyanobacterial genes encoding the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase or 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase gene, the first two enzymatic steps of the plastidial MEP pathway, from which plant diterpenes primarily derive. Plastid-targeted expression of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase proteins significantly enhanced the yield of aethiopinone by a 3-fold and about 6-fold increase, respectively. The accumulation of other abietane-type diterpenes (ferruginol, salvipisone, and carnosic acid), with interesting antiproliferative activity, was also increased. Compared to our previous data obtained by overexpressing the plant orthologous 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase genes in S. sclarea hairy roots, the results presented here confirm that the bacterial 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase enzyme plays a major role than the DXS enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of this class of compounds and that its ectopic expression does not conflict with active hairy root growth, resulting in a balanced trade-off between the transgenic hairy root final biomass and the increased content of o-naphto-quinone diterpenes, with interesting biological activities.","[Vaccaro, Mariacarmela; Bernal, Vivian Ocampo; Malafronte, Nicola; De Tommasi, Nunziatina; Leone, Antonietta] Univ Salerno, DIFARMA, Dept Pharm, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy",,"Leone, A (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, DIFARMA, Dept Pharm, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy.",Italy,Europe,Global North,aleone@unisa.it,"Malafronte, Nicola/AAR-5372-2020",,University of Salerno; COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FA1006],This work was supported by FARB 2013-funds from the University of Salerno provided to A.

Here, we identified and characterized SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT (SCD), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids in maize (Zea mays). SCD converts 2C-methyl-D-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In scd mutants, plant growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and seeds. This scd metabolic alteration varies among plant tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the scd mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in scd seeds and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, SCD-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various plant tissues and under different light conditions.","[Zhang, Lili; Zhang, Xuan; Wang, Xiaoji; Xu, Jing; Wang, Min; Fang, Hui; Hu, Shuting; Li, Jigang; Yang, Jianbing; Li, Jiansheng; Yang, Xiaohong] China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Plant Physiol & Biochem, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lili; Zhang, Xuan; Xu, Jing; Wang, Min; Fang, Hui; Hu, Shuting; Li, Jiansheng; Yang, Xiaohong] China Agr Univ, Natl Maize Improvement Ctr China, Ctr Crop Funct Genom & Mol Breeding, MOA Key Lab Maize Biol,Beijing Key Lab Crop Genet, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin] Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Key Lab Crop Genet Improvement, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Bai, Guanghong] Xinjiang Agr Univ, Agron Coll, Urumqi 830052, Peoples R China",,"Yang, XH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Plant Physiol & Biochem, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.; Yang, XH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Natl Maize Improvement Ctr China, Ctr Crop Funct Genom & Mol Breeding, MOA Key Lab Maize Biol,Beijing Key Lab Crop Genet, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,yxiaohong@cau.edu.cn,"min, wang/AAE-1843-2022; Li, Jigang/ABD-6301-2021; Li, Jigang/G-9446-2012","min, wang/0000-0001-6874-4282; Li, Jigang/0000-0002-4395-2656; Li, Jigang/0000-0002-4395-2656",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31671697]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0100503],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (31671697) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0100503).,75,10,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,APR,2019,179,4,10.1104/pp.18.01148,Plant Sciences,HR2UO,WOS:000462993100044,30718347,"Green Published, Bronze",

In Arabidopsis thaliana carotenoid biosynthesis is strongly upregulated when seedlings that germinate in the dark (etiolated) emerge from the soil and light derepresses photomorphogenesis, causing etioplasts to become chloroplasts. We found that carotenoid biosynthesis is also induced when deetiolation is derepressed in the absence of actual light, eventually resulting in improved greening (chlorophyll accumulation) upon illumination. The increased production of carotenoids in the dark correlates with an upregulated activity of phytoene synthase (PSY; the first committed enzyme of carotenogenesis) and the induction of PSY gene expression in cotyledons (where carotenoids accumulate in dark-grown seedlings). The metabolic precursors for carotenoid synthesis under these conditions are mostly supplied by the plastidial methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. Accumulation of flux-controlling MEP pathway enzymes, such as deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), is post-transcriptionally increased when deetiolation is derepressed in the dark. Unlike the situation observed in light-grown plants, however, the sole overexpression of DXS in dark-grown seedlings does not increase carotenoid accumulation. By contrast, induced expression of a PSY-encoding transgene results in increased carotenoid levels and a concomitant post-transcriptional accumulation of DXS. These data provide evidence for a feedback mechanism by which PSY controls metabolic flux to the carotenoid pathway in plants.","[Rodriguez-Villalon, Antia; Gas, Elisabet; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel] CSIC IRTA UAB, CRAG, Barcelona 08034, Spain",,"Rodriguez-Concepcion, M (corresponding author), CSIC IRTA UAB, CRAG, Jordi Girona 18, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,,"Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/I-7229-2015","Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/0000-0002-1280-2305; Gas-Pascual, Elisabet/0000-0002-2643-6916; Rodriguez-Villalon, Antia/0000-0001-8962-1353","Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia - FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [BIO2005-00367, BIO2008-00432, CSD2007-00036]; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de CatalunyaGeneral Electric [2005SGR-00914]; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de CatalunyaGeneral Electric","We thank J.

This mutant was found to be a new loss-of-function allele of PRL1 (Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus 1), a gene encoding a conserved WD-protein that functions as a global regulator of sugar, stress, and hormone responses, in part by inhibition of SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK1). Consistent with the reported role of SnRK1 kinases in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the main regulatory enzyme of the MVA pathway (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase), its activity but not transcript or protein levels was reduced in prl1 seedlings. However, the accumulation of MVA-derived end products (sterols) was unaltered in mutant seedlings. Sucrose supplementation to wild-type seedlings phenocopied the prl1 mutation in terms of isoprenoid metabolism, suggesting that the observed isoprenoid phenotypes result from the increased sugar accumulation in the prl1 mutant. In summary, PRL1 appears to coordinate isoprenoid metabolism with sugar, hormone, and stress responses.","[Flores-Perez, Ursula; Perez-Gila, Jordi; Botella-Pavia, Patricia; Phillips, Michael A.; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel] CSIC IRTA UAB, CRAG, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Closa, Marta; Ferrer, Albert] Univ Barcelona, Fac Farm, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Wright, Louwrance P.; Gershenzon, Jonathan] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Biochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany",,"Rodriguez-Concepcion, M (corresponding author), CSIC IRTA UAB, CRAG, Jordi Girona 18, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,mrcgmp@cid.csic.es,"Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/I-7229-2015; Wright, Louwrance P/D-9242-2011; Perez-Gil, Jordi/I-1853-2013; Ferrer, Albert/AAI-4595-2021; Ferrer, Antonio/H-2942-2015; Gershenzon, Jonathan/K-1331-2013","Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/0000-0002-1280-2305; Wright, Louwrance P/0000-0001-5998-6079; Perez-Gil, Jordi/0000-0002-5632-9556; Ferrer, Albert/0000-0002-0741-2388; Ferrer, Antonio/0000-0003-0532-711X; Gershenzon, Jonathan/0000-0002-1812-1551; Flores-Perez, Ursula/0000-0002-6780-3671","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government [BIO2005-00367, BIO2008-00432, BFU2006-00544, CSD2007-00036]; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de CatalunyaGeneral Electric [2005SGR-00914, XaRBa]; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government","This work was supported by grants from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (BIO2005-00367, BIO2008-00432, BFU2006-00544, and CSD2007-00036) and the Generalitat de Catalunya (2005SGR-00914 and XaRBa) to M.

However, little is known about the effects of plant hormones on the regulation of these pathways. In the present study we investigated the effect of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) on changes in the amounts of many produced terpenoids and the activity of the key enzymes, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), in these pathways. Our results showed GA(3) caused a decrease in DXS activity in both sexes that it was accompanied by a decrease in chlorophylls, carotenoids and delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contents and an increase in alpha-tocopherol content. The treated plants with GA(3) showed an increase in HMGR activity. This increase in HMGR activity was followed by accumulation of stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol in male and female plants and campestrol in male plants. The pattern of the changes in the amounts of sterols was exactly similar to the changes in the HMGR activity. These data suggest that GA(3) can probably influence the MEP and MVA pathways oppositely, with stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the produced primary terpenoids in MVA and DXS pathways, respectively.","[Mansouri, Hakimeh; Asrar, Zahra] Shahid Bahonar Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Kerman, Iran; [Mansouri, Hakimeh] Int Ctr Sci High Technol & Environm Sci ICST, Kerman, Iran; [Mehrabani, Mitra] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Dept Pharmacognosy, Fac Pharm, Kerman, Iran; [Mehrabani, Mitra] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Pharmaceut Res Ctr, Kerman, Iran",,"Mansouri, H (corresponding author), Shahid Bahonar Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Kerman, Iran.",Iran,Middle east,Global South,h_mansori@graduate.uk.ac.ir,"Mehrabani, Mitra/P-7981-2016","Mehrabani, Mitra/0000-0002-7217-9754; Mehrbani, Mitra/0000-0002-3865-5120; Mansouri, Hakimeh/0000-0002-0167-2154",,,51,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1672-9072,1744-7909,JUN,2009,51,6,10.1111/j.1744-7909.2009.00833.x,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,456KA,WOS:000266843200004,19522814,,

A functional color assay in E. coli showed that SmHDR1 accelerates the biosynthesis of beta-carotene, indicating that SmHDR1 encodes a functional protein. Overexpression of SmHDR1 enhanced the production of tanshinones in cultured hairy roots of S. miltiorrhiza Bge. f. alba. These results indicate that SmHDR1 is a novel and important enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diterpenoid tanshinones in S. miltiorrhiza Bge. f. alba. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The Escherichia coli IspH ( LytB) protein is involved in the last step of the nonmevalonate pathway. We have isolated an Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana) ispH null mutant that has an albino phenotype and have generated Arabidopsis transgenic lines showing various albino patterns caused by IspH transgene- induced gene silencing. The initiation of albino phenotypes rendered by IspH gene silencing can arise independently from multiple sites of the same plant. After a spontaneous initiation, the albino phenotype is systemically spread toward younger tissues along the source- to- sink flow relative to the initiation site. The development of chloroplasts is severely impaired in the IspH- deficient albino tissues. Instead of thylakoids, mutant chloroplasts are filled with vesicles. Immunoblot analysis reveals that Arabidopsis IspH is a chloroplast stromal protein. Expression of Arabidopsis IspH complements the lethal phenotype of an E. coli ispH mutant. In 2- week- old Arabidopsis seedlings, the expression of 1- deoxy- D- xylulose 5- phosphate synthase ( DXS), 1- deoxy- D- xylulose 5- phosphate reductoisomerase ( DXR), IspD, IspE, IspF, and IspG genes is induced by light, whereas the expression of the IspH gene is constitutive. The addition of 3% sucrose in the media slightly increased levels of DXS, DXR, IspD, IspE, and IspF mRNA in the dark. In a 16- h- light/ 8- h- dark photoperiod, the accumulation of the IspH transcript oscillates with the highest levels detected in the early light period ( 2 - 6 h) and the late dark period ( 4 - 6 h). The expression patterns of DXS and IspG are similar to that of IspH, indicating that these genes are coordinately regulated in Arabidopsis when grown in a 16- h- light/ 8- h- dark photoperiod.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Acad Sinica, Inst Plant & Microbial Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",,"Hsieh, MH (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,ming@gate.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,87,157,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,JUN,2005,138,2,10.1104/pp.104.058735,Plant Sciences,935IK,WOS:000229774200022,15863698,"Green Published, Bronze",

Bioactive abietanic diterpenes are synthesized in roots of Salvia sclarea (e.g. aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone, salvipisone, and ferruginol), but at a very low level (about 1 % of root dry weight). To enhance the biosynthesis of this interesting class of compounds, heterologous AtDXS (D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase) or AtDXR (1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5 phosphate reductoisomerase) genes, encoding the up-stream enzymes of the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)-dependent terpenoid pathway, were ectopically expressed in S. sclarea hairy roots. Quantitative targeted metabolic analysis (HPLC-DAD) revealed that three independent root lines, expressing different levels of DXS or DXR transcripts and proteins, synthesized a significant higher content of abietanic diterpenes, compared to the control hairy root line transformed with the empty vector. The increase was gene-dependent, since the overexpression of the AtDXR triggered a 4.4-fold increase in aethiopinone, an abietane quinone-type tricyclic diterpene. In addition, aethiopinone was proved to be cytotoxic to different solid tumor cell lines, with the highest effect on human melanoma A375 cell line (IC50 11.4 mu M). Overall these results show that it is possible to boost the metabolic flow towards the synthesis of abietanic diterpenes in S. sclarea hairy roots by overexpressing genes involved in the first steps of the MEP-pathway and provide new insights for the large-scale production of this class of compounds, with potential application in cancer treatment.","[Vaccaro, Mariacarmela; Malafronte, Nicola; Alfieri, Mariaevelina; De Tommasi, Nunziatina; Leone, Antonietta] Univ Salerno, Dept Pharm, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy",,"Vaccaro, M (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Dept Pharm, Via Giovanni Paolo 2,132, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy.",Italy,Europe,Global North,mvaccaro@unisa.it,"Malafronte, Nicola/AAR-5372-2020; De Tommasi, Nunziatina/A-7768-2011","De Tommasi, Nunziatina/0000-0003-1707-4156; Vaccaro, Maria Carmela/0000-0002-5194-2650; Alfieri, Mara/0000-0002-9594-1342","Research Project of National Interest (PRIN)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN); Italian Ministry of University of Education (MIUR)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR); COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FA1006]","This work was supported by funds provided to AL by the Research Project of National Interest (PRIN 2005), the Italian Ministry of University of Education (MIUR) and by a Short-Term Scientific Mission to MCV by COST Action FA1006 Plant Metabolic Engineering for High Value Products.

Here, we show that the first enzyme of the pathway, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), interacts with the J-protein J20 in Arabidopsis thaliana. J-proteins typically act as adaptors that provide substrate specificity to heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a molecular chaperone. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that J20 and DXS are found together in vivo and confirmed the presence of Hsp70 chaperones in DXS complexes. Mutants defective in J20 activity accumulated significantly increased levels of DXS protein (but no transcripts) and displayed reduced levels of DXS enzyme activity, indicating that loss of J20 function causes posttranscriptional accumulation of DXS in an inactive form. Furthermore, J20 promotes degradation of DXS following a heat shock. Together, our data indicate that J20 might identify unfolded or misfolded (damaged) forms of DXS and target them to the Hsp70 system for proper folding under normal conditions or degradation upon stress.","[Pulido, Pablo; Toledo-Ortiz, Gabriela; Phillips, Michael A.; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel] CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Ctr Res Agr Genom, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Wright, Louwrance P.] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, D-07745 Jena, Germany",,"Rodriguez-Concepcion, M (corresponding author), CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Ctr Res Agr Genom, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,manuel.rodriguez@cragenomica.es,"Pulido, Pablo/A-8093-2015; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/I-7229-2015; Wright, Louwrance P/D-9242-2011","Pulido, Pablo/0000-0001-9092-3674; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/0000-0002-1280-2305; Wright, Louwrance P/0000-0001-5998-6079; Toledo-Ortiz, Gabriela/0000-0003-4421-349X","Spanish Direccion General de InvestigacionSpanish Government [BIO2011-23680, PIM2010IPO-00660]; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de CatalunyaGeneral Electric [2009SGR-26]; Generalitat de Catalunya (XRB); Programa Iberoamericano de Ciencia y Tecnologia para el Desarrollo (IBERCAROT); European Union FP7 (TiMet) [245143]","We thank Hsou-Min Li, Eva-Mari Aro, and the European Stock Centre for seeds from mutant lines, Michael Walter for the DXR antibody, and Wolfgang Eisenreich for the gift of labeled DXP.

The precursors for carotenoid production are synthesized through the recently elucidated methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Here we have identified a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cDNA sequence encoding a full-length protein with homology to the MEP pathway enzyme hydroxymethylbutenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS, also called GCPE). Comparison with other plant and bacterial HDS sequences showed that the plant enzymes contain a plastid-targeting N-terminal sequence and two highly conserved plant-specific domains in the mature protein with no homology to any other sequence in the databases. The ubiquitous distribution of HDS-encoding expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the tomato collections suggests that the corresponding gene is likely expressed throughout the plant. The role of HDS in controlling the supply of precursors for carotenoid biosynthesis was estimated from the bioinformatic and molecular analysis of transcript abundance in different stages of fruit development. No significant changes in HDS gene expression were deduced from the statistical analysis of EST distribution during fruit ripening, when an active MEP pathway is required to support a massive accumulation of carotenoids. RNA blot experiments confirmed that similar transcript levels were present in both the wild-type and carotenoid-depleted yellow, ripe (r) mutant fruit independent of the stage of development and the carotenoid composition of the fruit. Together, our results are consistent with a non-limiting role for HDS in carotenoid biosynthesis during tomato fruit ripening.","Univ Barcelona, Fac Quim, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",,"Rodriguez-Concepeion, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Quim, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Marti & Franques 1-7, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,,"imperial, santiago/K-4963-2017; Querol-Audi, Jordi/AAJ-9259-2021; Lois, L.Maria/N-5822-2014; Lois, L.

DXS catalyzes the formation of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) from pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. DXR catalyzes the formation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) from DXP. Previous studies of the DXS and DXR genes have focused on herbs, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and Amomum villosum, but few studies have been conducted on woody plants. For that reason, we chose Populus trichocarpa as a model woody plant for investigating the DXS and DXR genes. PtDXS exhibited the highest expression level in leaves and the lowest expression in roots. PtDXR showed maximum expression in young leaves, and the lowest expression in mature leaves. The expression profiles revealed by RT-PCR following different elicitor treatments such as abscisic acid, NaCl, PEG(6000), H2O2, and cold stress showed that PtDXS and PtDXR were elicitor-responsive genes. Our results showed that the PtDXS gene exhibited diurnal changes, but PtDXR did not. Moreover, overexpression of PtDXR in transgenic poplars improved tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Those results showed that the PtDXR encoded a functional protein, and widely participates in plant growth and development, stress physiological process.","[Xu, Chen; Wei, Hui; Movahedi, Ali; Sun, Weibo; Ma, Xiaoxing; Li, Dawei; Yin, Tongming; Zhuge, Qiang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Key Lab Forest Genet & Biotechnol, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chen] Nanjing Xiaozhuang Univ, Nanjing Key Lab Qual & Safety Agr Prod, Nanjing 211171, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Zhuge, Q (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Key Lab Forest Genet & Biotechnol, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,qzhuge@njfu.edu.cn,"Movahedi, Ali/AAH-7379-2019","Movahedi, Ali/0000-0001-5062-504X",National Key Program on Transgenic Research [2018ZX08020002]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31570650]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"This work was supported by the National Key Program on Transgenic Research(2018ZX08020002), the National Science Foundation of China (No. 31570650) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",39,8,ELSEVIER FRANCE-EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER,ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX,"65 RUE CAMILLE DESMOULINS, CS50083, 92442 ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX, FRANCE",0981-9428,,SEP,2019,142,,10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.05.034,Plant Sciences,JA1HX,WOS:000487569200011,31279136,,

We have previously shown that the production of diterpene hydrocarbons leading to phytoalexins and the expression of related biosynthetic genes are activated in suspension-cultured rice cells upon elicitor treatment. To better understand the elicitor-induced activation of phytoalexin biosynthesis, we conducted microarray analysis using suspension-cultured rice cells collected at various times after treatment with chitin elicitor. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two types of early-induced expression (EIE-1,EIE-2) nodes and a late-induced expression ( LIE) node that includes genes involved in phytoalexins biosynthesis. The LIE node contains genes that may be responsible for the methylerythritol phosphate ( MEP) pathway, a plastidic biosynthetic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate, an early precursor of phytoalexins. The elicitor-induced expression of these putative MEP pathway genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine5'- diphospho)2- C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E. coli mutants disrupted in the corresponding genes. Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor. These results suggest that activation of the MEP pathway is required to supply sufficient terpenoid precursors for the production of phytoalexins in infected rice plants.","Univ Tokyo, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; Meiji Seika Kaisha Ltd, Food & Hlth R&D Lab, Sakado, Saitama 3500289, Japan; Meiji Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Life Sci, Tama Ku, Kanagawa 2148571, Japan",,"Okada, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,ukokada@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Shimizu, Takafumi/C-4123-2017","Shimizu, Takafumi/0000-0003-4372-1337; Nojiri, Hideaki/0000-0003-3091-8691; Koga, Jinichiro/0000-0003-2106-9894; Kuzuyama, Tomohisa/0000-0002-7221-5858",,,46,105,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4412,,SEP,2007,65,2-Jan,10.1007/s11103-007-9207-2,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,201EX,WOS:000248815400013,17634747,,

We used green fluorescent fusion protein assays to demonstrate that the Arabidopsis MEP pathway enzymes are localized to the chloroplast. We have also characterized three Arabidopsis albino mutants, ispD-1, ispD-2 and ispE-1, which have T-DNA insertions in the IspD and IspE genes of the MEP pathway. Levels of photosynthetic pigments are almost undetectable in these albino mutants. Instead of thylakoids, the ispD and ispE mutant chloroplasts are filled with large vesicles. Impairments in chloroplast development and functions may signal changes in the expression of nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genes. We used northern blot analysis to examine the expression of photosynthetic and respiratory genes in the ispD and ispE albino mutants. Steady-state mRNA levels of nucleus- and chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic genes are significantly decreased in the albino mutants. In contrast, transcript levels of nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain are increased or not affected in these mutants. Genomic Southern blot analysis revealed that the DNA amounts of mitochondrial genes are not enhanced in the ispD and ispE albino mutants. These results support the notion that the functional state of chloroplasts may affect the expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes. The up-regulation of mitochondrial genes in the albino mutants is not caused by changes of mitochondrial DNA copy number in Arabidopsis.","[Hsieh, Ming-Hsiun; Chang, Chiung-Yun; Hsu, Shih-Jui; Chen, Ju-Jiun] Acad Sinica, Inst Plant & Microbial Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",,"Hsieh, MH (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Plant & Microbial Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",Taiwan,Asia,Global North,ming@gate.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,48,92,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4412,1573-5028,APR,2008,66,6,10.1007/s11103-008-9297-5,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,276AY,WOS:000254114700008,18236010,,

Here, we present the first genome-wide association study for the important ornamental crop rose, focusing on the anthocyanin and carotenoid contents in petals of 96 diverse tetraploid garden rose genotypes. Cultivated roses display a vast phenotypic and genetic diversity and are therefore ideal targets for association genetics. For marker analysis, we used a recently designed Axiom SNP chip comprising 68,000 SNPs with additionally 281 SSRs, 400 AFLPs and 246 markers from candidate genes. An analysis of the structure of the rose population revealed three subpopulations with most of the genetic variation between individual genotypes rather than between clusters and with a high average proportion of heterozygous loci. The mapping of markers significantly associated with anthocyanin and carotenoid content to the related Fragaria and Prunus genomes revealed clusters of associated markers indicating five genomic regions associated with the total anthocyanin content and two large clusters associated with the carotenoid content. Among the marker clusters associated with the phenotypes, we found several candidate genes with known functions in either the anthocyanin or the carotenoid biosynthesis pathways. Among others, we identified a glutathione-S-transferase, 4CL, an auxin response factor and F3'H as candidate genes affecting anthocyanin concentration, and CCD4 and Zeaxanthine epoxidase as candidates affecting the concentration of carotenoids. These markers are starting points for future validation experiments in independent populations as well as for functional genomic studies to identify the causal factors for the observed color phenotypes. Furthermore, validated markers may be interesting tools for marker-assisted selection in commercial breeding programmes in that they provide the tools to identify superior parental combinations that combine several associated markers in higher dosages.","[Schulz, Dietmar F.; Schott, Rena T.; Linde, Marcus; Debener, Thomas] Leibnitz Univ Hannover, Inst Plant Genet, Abt Mol Pflanzenzuchtung, Hannover, Germany; [Voorrips, Roeland E.; Smulders, Marinus J.

In poplar (Populus spp.), it has recently been shown that the gene encoding the synthesizing enzyme for isoprene, isoprene synthase (ISPS), displays diurnal variation in expression. Working on shoot cultures of Grey poplar (Populus x canescens) placed under a different light regime in phytochambers, we showed that these variations in PcISPS gene expression, measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, are not only due to day-night changes, but also are linked to an internal circadian clock. Measurement of additional selected isoprenoid genes revealed that phytoene synthase (carotenoid pathway) displays similar fluctuations, whereas 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, possibly the first committed enzyme of the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway, only shows light regulation. On the protein level, it appeared that PcISPS activity and protein content became reduced under constant darkness, whereas under constant light, activity and protein content of this enzyme were kept high. In contrast, isoprene emission rates under continuous irradiation displayed circadian changes as is the case for gene expression of PcISPS. Furthermore, binding assays with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) late elongated hypocotyl, a transcription factor of Arabidopsis involved in circadian regulation, clearly revealed the presence of circadian-determining regulatory elements in the promoter region of PcISPS.","Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany",,"Louis, S (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,sandrine.louis@imk.fzk.de,"Zimmer, Ina/M-1295-2015; Rosenkranz, Maaria/B-3338-2013; Schnitzler, Joerg-Peter/C-5268-2011","Zimmer, Ina/0000-0002-6441-8495; Rosenkranz, Maaria/0000-0002-1421-112X; Schnitzler, Joerg-Peter/0000-0002-9825-867X",,,63,75,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,JAN,2007,143,1,10.1104/pp.106.092759,Plant Sciences,124EP,WOS:000243350600048,17122071,"Bronze, Green Published",

These changes were dependent on the developmental stage and were strongly correlated to temperature and light. The expression rates of the genes PcDXR and PcISPS were found to be significantly correlated to each other, whereas the expression of the PcPSY gene showed a different seasonal pattern. Protein concentration and enzyme activity of PcISPS showed distinct seasonal patterns peaking in late summer, whereas highest transcription levels of PcISPS were observed in early summer. Moreover, correlation between PcISPS protein concentration and enzyme activity changed, in particular in autumn, when PcISPS protein levels remained high while enzyme activity declined, indicating posttranslational modifications of the enzyme. The positive correlation between dimethylallyl diphosphate levels and PcISPS protein content was found to be consistent with the demonstrated synchronized regulation of PcDXR and PcISPS, suggesting that metabolic flux through the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate pathway and isoprene emission capacity are closely intercoordinated. Transcript levels of PcISPS showed strong diurnal variation with maximal values before midday in contrast to PcDXR, whose gene expression exhibited no clear intraday changes. During the course of a day, in vitro PcISPS activities did not change, whereas leaf dimethylallyl diphosphate levels and isoprene emission showed strong diurnal variations depending on actual temperature and light profiles on the respective day. These results illustrate that the regulation of isoprene biosynthesis in Grey poplar leaves seems to happen on transcriptional, posttranslational, and metabolic levels and is highly variable with respect to seasonal and diurnal changes in relation to temperature and light.","Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch Atmosphar Umweltforsc, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany",,"Fischbach, RJ (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch Atmosphar Umweltforsc, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,robert.fischbach@imk.fzk.de,"Schnitzler, Joerg-Peter/C-5268-2011; Zimmer, Ina/M-1295-2015","Schnitzler, Joerg-Peter/0000-0002-9825-867X; Zimmer, Ina/0000-0002-6441-8495",,,65,107,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,SEP,2005,139,1,10.1104/pp.105.066373,Plant Sciences,962WZ,WOS:000231765300045,16126852,"Green Published, Bronze",

SSU in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants increased the total GPPS activity and monoterpene emission from leaves and flowers, indicating that the introduced catalytically inactive GPPS. SSU found endogenous large subunit partner(s) and formed an active snapdragon/tobacco GPPS in planta. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and in vitro enzyme analysis of individual and hybrid proteins revealed that two of four GGPPS-like candidates from tobacco EST databases encode bona fide GGPPS that can interact with snapdragon GPPS. SSU and form a functional GPPS enzyme in plastids. The formation of chimeric GPPS in transgenic plants also resulted in leaf chlorosis, increased light sensitivity, and dwarfism due to decreased levels of chlorophylls, carotenoids, and gibberellins. In addition, these transgenic plants had reduced levels of sesquiterpene emission, suggesting that the export of isoprenoid intermediates from the plastids into the cytosol was decreased. These results provide genetic evidence that GPPS. SSU modifies the chain length specificity of phylogenetically distant GGPPS and can modulate IPP flux distribution between GPP and GGPP synthesis in planta.","[Orlova, Irina; Nagegowda, Dinesh A.; Kish, Christine M.; Gutensohn, Michael; Maeda, Hiroshi; Dudareva, Natalia] Purdue Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Varbanova, Marina; Fridman, Eyal; Pichersky, Eran] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yamaguchi, Shinjiro; Hanada, Atsushi; Kamiya, Yuji] RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Krichevsky, Alexander; Citovsky, Vitaly] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,"Dudareva, N (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,dudareva@purdue.edu,"Yamaguchi, Shinjiro/F-9684-2010; Dudareva, Natalia/S-8710-2017; Nagegowda, Dinesh/A-5480-2012; Kamiya, Yuji/F-9420-2010; Maeda, Hiroshi/G-4172-2010","Dudareva, Natalia/0000-0003-0777-7763; Nagegowda, Dinesh/0000-0002-9418-8918; Kamiya, Yuji/0000-0003-4415-520X; Citovsky, Vitaly/0000-0003-2024-6844","National Science Foundation/USDA-National Research Initiative (NRI) Interagency Metabolic Engineering ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [MCB 0331333, MCB 0331353]; Fred Gloeckner Foundation; National Cancer Institutes's [NIHNCI-2P30CA23168]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P30CA023168] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work is supported by National Science Foundation/USDA-National Research Initiative (NRI) Interagency Metabolic Engineering Program, Grants MCB 0331333 (N.D.) and MCB 0331353 (E.P.), and by a grant from the Fred Gloeckner Foundation to N.D.

To explore the potential mechanisms underlying differences in the fragrances among genotypes of this plant, we analyzed floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from two different genotypes: SW001, which has little to no fragrance, and the scented genotype H29. The major VOCs in H29 were linalool, trans-beta-ocimene, benzyl acetate, methyl salicylate, benzyl alcohol (BAlc) and methyl benzoate. The most important aroma-active compound in H29, linalool, was emitted at a low concentration in SW001, which had markedly higher levels of trans-beta-ocimene than H29. Next, to investigate scent biosynthesis, we analyzed the transcriptome and proteome of fully open flowers of the two genotypes. A total of 14 443 differentially expressed unigenes and 196 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Further analyses indicated that 56 differentially expressed genes involved in the terpenoid and benzenoid biosynthesis pathways might play critical roles in regulating floral fragrance difference. Disequilibrium expression of four terpene synthase genes resulted in diverse emission of linalool and trans-beta-ocimene in both genotypes. In addition, the expressions of two CpMYC2 transcription factors were both upregulated in H29, implying that they may regulate linalool production. Notably, 16 of 20 genes in the benzenoid biosynthesis pathway were downregulated, corresponding to the relatively low level of benzenoid production in SW001. The lack of benzyl acetate might indicate that SW001 may lack substrate BAlc or functional acetyl-CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase.","[Tian, Jing-Pu; Ma, Zhi-Yao; Zhao, Kai-Ge; Zhang, Jie; Xiang, Lin] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Key Lab Hort Plant Biol, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Long-Qing] Southwest Forestry Univ, Southwest Res Ctr Engn Technol Landscape Architec, State Forestry Adm, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China",,"Xiang, L (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Key Lab Hort Plant Biol, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Chen, LQ (corresponding author), Southwest Forestry Univ, Southwest Res Ctr Engn Technol Landscape Architec, State Forestry Adm, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,xianglin@mail.hzau.edu.cn; chenlq@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,"Tian, jingpu/0000-0003-4748-210X",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31572165],"We would like to thank three master candidates (J.

We have analysed the genes encoding the seven enzymes of the MEP pathway in melon (Cucumis melo L.) and determined that the first one, 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), and the last one, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (HDR), are represented in the genome as a small gene family and paralogous pair, respectively. In the case of DXS, three genes encode functional DXS activities which fall into previously established type I (CmDXS1) and II (CmDXS2a and CmDXS2b) categories, while a fourth DXS-like gene belonging to the type III group did not encode a protein with DXS activity. Their expression patterns and phylogenies suggest that CmDXS1 is functionally specialized for developmental and photosynthetic processes, while CmDXS2a and CmDXS2b are induced in flowers and ripening fruit of orange- (but not white-) fleshed varieties, coinciding with beta-carotene accumulation. This is the first instance connecting type II DXS genes to specialized isoprenoid biosynthesis in the fruit of an agronomically important species. Two HDR paralogues were shown to encode functional enzymes, although only CmHDR1 was highly expressed in the tissues and developmental stages tested. Phylogenetic analysis showed that in cucurbits such as melon, these HDR paralogues probably arose through individual gene duplications in a common angiosperm ancestor, mimicking a prior division in gymnosperms, while other flowering plants, including apple, soy, canola, and poplar, acquired HDR duplicates recently as homoeologues through large-scale genome duplications. We report the influence of gene duplication history on the regulation of the MEP pathway in melon and the role of specialized MEP-pathway isoforms in providing precursors for beta-carotene production in orange-fleshed melon varieties.","[Saladie, Montserrat; Garcia-Mas, Jordi] CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Plant & Anim Genom Programme, Inst Recerca & Tecnol Agroalimentaries, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Saladie, Montserrat; Garcia-Mas, Jordi] CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Ctr Res Agr Genom, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Wright, Louwrance P.] Max Planck Inst Chem Oekol, Dept Biochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel; Phillips, Michael A.] CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Plant Metab & Metab Engn Programme, Ctr Res Agr Genom, Barcelona 08193, Spain",,"Phillips, MA (corresponding author), CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Plant Metab & Metab Engn Programme, Ctr Res Agr Genom, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,michael.phillips@cragenomica.es,"Wright, Louwrance P/D-9242-2011; Saladie, Montserrat/AAA-8352-2019; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/I-7229-2015; Garcia-Mas, Jordi/B-9694-2012","Wright, Louwrance P/0000-0001-5998-6079; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/0000-0002-1280-2305; Garcia-Mas, Jordi/0000-0001-7101-9049; Saladie Foraste, Montserrat/0000-0002-0088-7233",,,69,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0022-0957,1460-2431,SEP,2014,65,17,10.1093/jxb/eru275,Plant Sciences,AQ6MN,WOS:000342927200030,25013119,"Green Published, hybrid",Hybrid

To assess the organ-specificity and developmental characteristics of GbLPS expression, the GbLPS promoter-driven GUS expression in transgenic Arabidopsis was studied. Histological analysis of the transgenic Arabidopsis plant showed that the GUS accumulation was mainly localized in the epidermis of leaves, phloem of the shoots, ovaries and stamens of flowers, and vasculature of roots. These observations correlate with the occurrence of LPS transcripts in roots and male strobili of . Treatment of methyl jasmonate on the transformant exhibited significant upregulation of the reporter gene in the roots with little change in leaves and flowers.

Many physiological processes in chloroplast are affected, including the plastidic isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway [the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4phosphate (MEP) pathway]; indeed, isoprenoid contents have been demonstrated to be altered in virus-infected plants. In this study, we found that the levels of photosynthetic pigments and abscisic acid (ABA) were altered in Potato virus Y (PVY)-infected tobacco. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we demonstrated an interaction between virus protein PVY helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) and tobacco chloroplast protein 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (NtDXS). This interaction was confirmed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays and pull-down assays. The Transket_ pyr domain (residues 394-561) of NtDXS was required for interaction with HC-Pro, while the N-terminal region of HC-Pro (residues 1-97) was necessary for interaction with NtDXS. Using in vitro enzyme activity assays, PVY HC-Pro was found to promote the synthase activity of NtDXS. We observed increases in photosynthetic pigment contents and ABA levels in transgenic plants with HC-Pro accumulating in the chloroplasts. During virus infection, the enhancement of plastidic isoprenoid biosynthesis was attributed to the enhancement of DXS activity by HC-Pro. Our study reveals a new role of HC-Pro in the host plant metabolic system and will contribute to the study of host-virus relationships.","[Li, Heng; Ma, Dongyuan; Jin, Yongsheng; Tu, Yayi; Liu, Liping; Leng, Chunxu; Dong, Jiangli; Wang, Tao] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",,"Dong, JL (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,dongjl@cau.edu.cn; wangt@cau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30830077],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30830077).,68,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,OCT,2015,38,10,10.1111/pce.12526,Plant Sciences,CU9SA,WOS:000363884200006,25736930,Bronze,Bronze

However, our knowledge of the genetic basis of selecting for kernel nutritional traits is limited. Here, we identified both single and epistatic quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contributed to the differences of oil and carotenoid traits between maize and teosinte. Over half of teosinte alleles of single QTLs increased the values of the detected oil and carotenoid traits. Based on the pleiotropism or linkage information of the identified single QTLs, we constructed a trait-locus network to help clarify the genetic basis of correlations among oil and carotenoid traits. Furthermore, the selection features and evolutionary trajectories of the genes or loci underlying variations in oil and carotenoid traits revealed that these nutritional traits produced diverse selection events during maize domestication and improvement. To illustrate more, a mutator distance-relative transposable element (TE) in intron 1 of DXS2, which encoded a rate-limiting enzyme in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, was identified to increase carotenoid biosynthesis by enhancing DXS2 expression. This TE occurs in the grass teosinte, and has been found to have undergone selection during maize domestication and improvement, and is almost fixed in yellow maize. Our findings not only provide important insights into evolutionary changes in nutritional traits, but also highlight the feasibility of reintroducing back into commercial agricultural germplasm those nutritionally important genes hidden in wild relatives.","[Fang, Hui; Fu, Xiuyi; Xu, Jing; Feng, Haiying; Li, Weiya; Jittham, Orawan; Zhang, Xuan; Zhang, Lili; Xu, Gen; Wang, Min; Li, Xiaowei; Li, Jiansheng; Yang, Xiaohong] China Agr Univ, Natl Maize Improvement Ctr China, Beijing Key Lab Crop Genet Improvement, MOA Key Lab Maize Biol,State Key Lab Plant Physio, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xiuyi] Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Maize Res Ctr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuebin; Xu, Jieting; Yang, Ning; Yan, Jianbing] Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Key Lab Crop Genet Improvement, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Yang, XH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Natl Maize Improvement Ctr China, Beijing Key Lab Crop Genet Improvement, MOA Key Lab Maize Biol,State Key Lab Plant Physio, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,yxiaohong@cau.edu.cn,,"Wang, Min/0000-0001-6874-4282; Li, Weiya/0000-0002-6106-8530; Fang, Hui/0000-0002-3400-9746; XU, GEN/0000-0001-5701-4751","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0100503]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31421005, 31722039, 31361140362]","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0100503) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31421005, 31722039, 31361140362).",82,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-7412,1365-313X,JAN,2020,101,2,10.1111/tpj.14539,Plant Sciences,KF8PJ,WOS:000494991800001,31529523,Bronze,Bronze

The first two steps in the MEP pathway are catalyzed by the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and reductoisomerase (DXR) enzymes. While DXS has been recently shown to be the main flux-controlling step of the MEP pathway, both DXS and DXR enzymes have been proven to be able to promote an increase in MEP-derived products when overproduced in diverse plant systems. Carrot (Daucus carota) produces photosynthetic pigments (carotenoids and chlorophylls) in leaves and in light-exposed roots, whereas only carotenoids (mainly alpha- and beta-carotene) accumulate in the storage root in darkness. To evaluate whether DXS and DXR activities influence the production of carotenoids and chlorophylls in carrot leaves and roots, the corresponding Arabidopsis thallana genes were constitutively expressed in transgenic carrot plants. Our results suggest that DXS is limiting for the production of both carotenoids and chlorophylls in roots and leaves, whereas the regulatory role of DXR appeared to be minor. Interestingly, increased levels of DXS (but not of DXR) resulted in higher transcript abundance of endogenous carrot genes encoding phytoene synthase, the main rate-determining enzyme of the carotenoid pathway. These results support a central role for DXS on modulating the production of MEP-derived precursors to synthesize carotenoids and chlorophylls in carrot, confirming the pivotal relevance of this enzyme to engineer healthier, carotenoid-enriched products.","[Simpson, Kevin; Quiroz, Luis F.; Stenge, Claudia R.] Univ Chile, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Plant Mol Biol Lab, Santiago, Chile; [Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel] Univ Barcelona, Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CSIC, Ctr Res Agr Genom,Inst Recerca & Tecnol Agroalime, Barcelona, Spain",,"Stenge, CR (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Plant Mol Biol Lab, Santiago, Chile.",Chile,South America,Global South,cstange@uchile.cl,"Stange, Claudia/H-7411-2013; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/I-7229-2015","Stange, Claudia/0000-0002-2265-0472; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/0000-0002-1280-2305; Quiroz Iturra, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-7907-7320",Chilean Regular Fondecyt [1130245]; CSIC [11/12]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BIO2014-59092-P]; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de CatalunyaGeneral Electric [2014SGR-1434]; Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence [SEV-2015-0533],"This work was funded by the Chilean Regular Fondecyt 1130245 of CS, CSIC 11/12 of CS and MR-C and grants from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (BIO2014-59092-P) and Generalitat de Catalunya (2014SGR-1434) to MR-C.

Its economic importance is due to presence of fragrance rich essential oil in its foliage. The essential oil is a mixture of various volatile phytochemicals which are mainly terpenes (isoprenoids) in nature. In this study, on the geranium foliage genes related to isoprenoid biosynthesis (DXS, DXR and HMGR) were isolated, cloned and confirmed by sequencing. Further, the first gene of 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (GrDXS), was made full length by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy. GrDXS contained a 2157bp open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 792 amino acids having calculated molecular weight 77.5 kDa. This study is first report on heterologous expression and kinetic characterization of any gene from this economically important plant. Expression analysis of these genes was performed in different tissues as well as at different developmental stages of leaves. In response to external elicitors, such as methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, light and wounding, all the three genes showed differential expression profiles. Further GrDXS was over expressed in the homologous (rose-scented geranium) as well as in heterologous (Withania somnifera) plant systems through genetic transformation approach. The over-expression of GrDXS led to enhanced secondary metabolites production (i.e. essential oil in rose-scented geranium and withanolides in W. somnifera). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the expression profile of the three genes related to isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways operated in rose-scented geranium as well as functional characterization study of any gene from rose-scented geranium through a genetic transformation system.","[Jadaun, Jyoti Singh; Sangwan, Neelam S.; Narnoliya, Lokesh K.; Singh, Neha; Bansal, Shilpi; Mishra, Bhawana; Sangwan, Rajender Singh] CSIR Cent Inst Med & Aromat Plants CSIR CIMAP, Dept Metab & Struct Biol, Lucknow 226015, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sangwan, Rajender Singh] Ctr Innovat & Appl Bioproc, C-127,Phase 8,Ind Area,SAS Nagar, Mohali 160071, Punjab, India",,"Sangwan, NS; Sangwan, RS (corresponding author), CSIR Cent Inst Med & Aromat Plants CSIR CIMAP, Dept Metab & Struct Biol, Lucknow 226015, Uttar Pradesh, India.; Sangwan, RS (corresponding author), Ctr Innovat & Appl Bioproc, C-127,Phase 8,Ind Area,SAS Nagar, Mohali 160071, Punjab, India.",India,Asia,Global South,nss.cimap@gmail.com; dr.sangwan@gmail.com,"Narnoliya, Lokesh Kumar/M-8027-2013; Jadaun, Jyoti Singh/AAF-5135-2020; Sangwan, Neelam/AAF-4010-2021","Mishra, Bhawana/0000-0002-0777-8830; JADAUN, JYOTI/0000-0001-9276-4865","CSIR network projectCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India [BSC0203]; UGC, New DelhiUniversity Grants Commission, India; CSIR, New DelhiCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India","The authors are thankful to BSC0203 CSIR network project for providing financial assistance.

To understand the molecular mechanism of monoterpene synthesis in Lilium, we cloned two potential genes in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway, namely LiDXS and LiDXR, from the strong-flavored oriental Lilium 'Siberia' using a homology-based PCR strategy. The expression levels of LiDXS and LiDXR were consistent with the emission and accumulation of monoterpenes in different floral organs and during the floral development, indicating that these two genes may play key roles in monoterpene synthesis. Subcellular localization demonstrated that LiDXS and LiDXR are expressed in the chloroplasts. Ectopic expression in transgenic tobacco suggested that the flowers of LiDXS and LiDXR transgenic lines accumulated substantially more diterpene, sclareol, compared to the plants transformed with empty vector. Surprisingly, increased content of the monoterpene, linalool and sesquiterpene, caryophyllene, were detected in the LiDXR transgenic lines, whereas the emission of caryophyllene, increased in one of the LiDXS transgenic tobacco lines, indicating that these two genes play significant roles in the synthesis of floral volatiles in the transgenic plants. These results demonstrate that LiDXR can contribute to monoterpene biosynthesis in Lilium 'Siberia'; however, the role of LiDXS in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes needs further study.","[Zhang, Tengxun; Sun, Ming; Guo, Yanhong; Shi, Xuejun; Yang, Yongjuan; Chen, Juntong; Zheng, Tangchun; Han, Yu; Bao, Fei; Ahmad, Sagheer] Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing Key Lab Ornamental Plants Germplasm Innov, Key Lab Genet & Breeding Forest Trees & Ornamenta, Minist Educ,Sch Landscape Architecture,Natl Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Sun, M (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing Key Lab Ornamental Plants Germplasm Innov, Key Lab Genet & Breeding Forest Trees & Ornamenta, Minist Educ,Sch Landscape Architecture,Natl Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,sunmingbjfu@163.com,"Ahmad, Sagheer/AAV-1945-2021","Ahmad, Sagheer/0000-0003-2218-8350; sun, ming/0000-0001-7037-0822; Han, Yu/0000-0001-5983-3873",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31501797]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015ZCQ-YL-03]; Special Fund for Beijing Common Construction Project,"This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 31501797), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2015ZCQ-YL-03), and the Special Fund for Beijing Common Construction Project.",57,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,9-Jul,2018,9,,10.3389/fpls.2018.00909,Plant Sciences,GM1QT,WOS:000437845600001,30038631,"Green Published, gold",Gold

Previous studies highlighted a key regulatory role for grapevine 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase 1 (VvDXS1), the first enzyme of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway for isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis. Here, the parallel analysis of VvDXS1 genotype and terpene concentration in a germplasm collection demonstrated that VvDXS1 sequence has a very high predictive value for the accumulation of monoterpenes and also has an influence on sesquiterpene levels. A metabolic engineering approach was applied by expressing distinct VvDXS1 alleles in the grapevine model system microvine and assessing the effects on downstream pathways at transcriptional and metabolic level in different organs and fruit developmental stages. The underlying goal was to investigate two potential perturbation mechanisms, the former based on a significant over-expression of the wild-type (neutral) VvDXS1 allele and the latter on the ex-novo expression of an enzyme with increased catalytic efficiency from the mutated (muscat) VvDXS1 allele. The integration of the two VvDXS1 alleles in distinct microvine lines was found to alter the expression of several terpenoid biosynthetic genes, as assayed through an ad hoc developed TaqMan array based on cDNA libraries of four aromatic cultivars. In particular, enhanced transcription of monoterpene, sesquiterpene and carotenoid pathway genes was observed. The accumulation of monoterpenes in ripe berries was higher in the transformed microvines compared to control plants. This effect is predominantly attributed to the improved activity of the VvDXS1 enzyme coded by the muscat allele, whereas the up-regulation of VvDXS1 plays a secondary role in the increase of monoterpenes.","[Dalla Costa, Lorenza; Emanuelli, Francesco; Trenti, Massimiliano; Moreno-Sanz, Paula; Lorenzi, Silvia; Costantini, Laura; Malnoy, Mickael; Grando, M.

Muscat flavor determination in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) has up to now been studied by evaluating monoterpenoid levels through QTL analysis. These studies have revealed co-localization of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (VvDXS) with the major QTL positioned on chromosome 5. Results: We resequenced VvDXS in an ad hoc association population of 148 grape varieties, which included muscat-flavored, aromatic and neutral accessions as well as muscat-like aromatic mutants and non-aromatic offsprings of Muscats. Gene nucleotide diversity and intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD) were evaluated. Structured association analysis revealed three SNPs in moderate LD to be significantly associated with muscat-flavored varieties. We identified a putative causal SNP responsible for a predicted non-neutral substitution and we discuss its possible implications for flavor metabolism. Network analysis revealed a major star-shaped cluster of reconstructed haplotypes unique to muscat-flavored varieties. Moreover, muscat-like aromatic mutants displayed unique non-synonymous mutations near the mutated site of Muscat genotypes. Conclusions: This study is a crucial step forward in understanding the genetic regulation of muscat flavor in grapevine and it also sheds light on the domestication history of Muscats. VvDXS appears to be a possible human-selected locus in grapevine domestication and post-domestication. The putative causal SNP identified in Muscat varieties as well as the unique mutations identifying the muscat-like aromatic mutants under study may be immediately applied in marker-assisted breeding programs aimed at enhancing fragrance and aroma complexity respectively in table grape and wine cultivars.","[Emanuelli, Francesco; Battilana, Juri; Costantini, Laura; Grando, Maria S.] Fdn Edmund Mach, Ist Agr San Michele Alladige, Res & Innovat Ctr, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy; [Le Cunff, Loic; Boursiquot, Jean-Michel; This, Patrice] INRA, UMR Divers & Adaptat Plantes Cultivees, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Le Cunff, Loic] UMI GenoVigne, IFV INRA Montpellier Supagro, F-34060 Montpellier, France",,"Emanuelli, F (corresponding author), Fdn Edmund Mach, Ist Agr San Michele Alladige, Res & Innovat Ctr, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy.",Italy,Europe,Global North,francesco.emanuelli@iasma.it,"Grando, Maria Stella/D-5448-2011; Emanuelli, Francesco/I-7592-2013","Grando, Maria Stella/0000-0002-6889-1968;",COST Action 858 Viticulture,"We would like to thank Claudio Varotto for providing very helpful comments and suggestions and Alexandre Fournier Level for many inspiring discussions.

In recent decades, the later steps of artemisinin biosynthesis have been thoroughly investigated; however, little is known about the early steps of artemisinin biosynthesis. Comparative transcriptomics of glandular and filamentous trichomes and (CO2)-C-13 radioisotope study have shown that the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, rather than the mevalonate pathway, plays an important role in artemisinin biosynthesis. In this study, we have cloned three 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes from A. annua (AaDXS1, AaDXS2, and AaDXS3); the DXS enzyme catalyzes the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the MEP pathway. We analyzed the expression of these three genes in different tissues in response to multiple treatments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of the three DXS genes belonged to a distinct clade. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that all three AaDXS proteins are targeted to chloroplasts, which is consistent with the presence of plastid transit peptides in their N-terminal regions. Expression analyses revealed that the expression pattern of AaDXS2 in specific tissues and in response to different treatments, including methyl jasmonate, light, and low temperature, was similar to that of artemisinin biosynthesis genes. To further investigate the tissue-specific expression pattern of AaDXS2, the promoter of AaDXS2 was cloned upstream of the beta-glucuronidase gene and was introduced in arabidopsis. Histochemical staining assays demonstrated that AaDXS2 was mainly expressed in the trichomes of Arabidopsis leaves. Together, these results suggest that AaDXS2 might be the only member of the DXS family in A. annua that is involved in artemisinin biosynthesis.","[Zhang, Fangyuan; Xia, Jing; Zeng, Junlan; Xiang, Lien; Zhu, Shunqin; Zheng, Qiumin; Yang, Chunxian; Liao, Zhihua] Southwest Univ, Sch Life Sci,Minist Educ, SWU TAAHC Med Plant Joint R&D Ctr,Key Lab Ecoenvi, Chongqing Key Lab Plant Ecol & Resources Res Gorg, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wanhong] Chongqing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Xie, He] Yunnan Acad Tobacco Agr Sci, Natl Tobacco Genet Engn Res Ctr, Tobacco Breeding & Biotechnol Res Ctr, Key Lab Tobacco Biotechnol Breeding, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Min] Southwest Univ, Coll Pharmaceut Sci, SWU TAAHC Med Plant Joint R&D Ctr, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,"Liao, ZH (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Sch Life Sci,Minist Educ, SWU TAAHC Med Plant Joint R&D Ctr,Key Lab Ecoenvi, Chongqing Key Lab Plant Ecol & Resources Res Gorg, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,zhliao@swu.edu.cn,,,"NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31770335, 31300333]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [XDJK2016C114]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M582497]; Foundation of YNTC [2016YN22]; National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of China [201710635075]; Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission [KJ1501321]; Chongqing Science and Technology CommissionNatural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC [cstc2016shmszx80101]; open fund of Chongqing Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microorganism [LIFM201714]","This work was financially supported by the NSFC project (31770335 and 31300333), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (XDJK2016C114), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015M582497), Foundation of YNTC (2016YN22), the National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of China (201710635075), the Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJ1501321), Chongqing Science and Technology Commission (cstc2016shmszx80101), and the open fund of Chongqing Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microorganism (LIFM201714).",46,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,2-Aug,2018,9,,10.3389/fpls.2018.00952,Plant Sciences,GP1EN,WOS:000440557200001,30116250,"Green Published, gold",Gold

Although some exchange of precursors occurs, cytosolic sesquiterpenes are assumed to derive mainly from MVA, while plastidial monoterpenes are produced preferentially from MEP precursors. Additional complexity arises in the first step of the MEP pathway, which is typically catalyzed by two divergent 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase isoforms (DXS1, DXS2). In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the SlDXS1 gene is ubiquitously expressed with highest levels during fruit ripening, whereas SlDXS2 transcripts are abundant in only few tissues, including young leaves, petals, and isolated trichomes. Specific down-regulation of SlDXS2 expression was performed by RNA interference in transgenic plants to investigate feedback mechanisms. SlDXS2 down-regulation led to a decrease in the monoterpene beta-phellandrene and an increase in two sesquiterpenes in trichomes. Moreover, incorporation of MVA-derived precursors into residual monoterpenes and into sesquiterpenes was elevated as determined by comparison of C-13 to C-12 natural isotope ratios. A compensatory up-regulation of SlDXS1 was not observed. Down-regulated lines also exhibited increased trichome density and showed less damage by leaf-feeding Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars. The results reveal novel, non-redundant roles of DXS2 in modulating isoprenoid metabolism and a pronounced plasticity in isoprenoid precursor allocation.","[Paetzold, Heike; Wieczorek, Jenny; Strack, Dieter; Hause, Bettina; Walter, Michael H.] Leibniz Inst Pflanzenbiochem, Abt Sekundarstoffwechsel, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Garms, Stefan; Bartram, Stefan; Boland, Wilhelm] Max Planck Inst Chem Okol, Abt Bioorgan Chem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Uros-Gracia, Eva-Maria; Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel] CSIC IRTA UAB, CRAG, Barcelona 08034, Spain",,"Walter, MH (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Pflanzenbiochem, Abt Sekundarstoffwechsel, Weinberg 3, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,mhwalter@ipb-halle.de,"Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/I-7229-2015; Walter, Michael H/F-4397-2012; Boland, Wilhelm/K-7762-2012","Rodriguez-Concepcion, Manuel/0000-0002-1280-2305; Boland, Wilhelm/0000-0001-6784-2534; Bartram, Stefan/0000-0002-8574-2817; Walter, Michael/0000-0003-1138-0232","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Bonn, Germany)German Research Foundation (DFG) [WA 536/5-1]","This work was supported in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Bonn, Germany) by grant WA 536/5-1.",67,82,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",1674-2052,1752-9867,SEP,2010,3,5,10.1093/mp/ssq032,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,654NB,WOS:000282173900011,20591838,"Green Submitted, Bronze",

Plant DXR and DXS enzymes have been reported to function differently depending on the plant species. In this study, the differential roles of rice DXS and DXR genes in carotenoid metabolism were investigated. Results The accumulation of carotenoids in rice seeds co-expressing OsDXS2 and stPAC was largely enhanced by 3.4-fold relative to the stPAC seeds and 315.3-fold relative to non-transgenic (NT) seeds, while the overexpression of each OsDXS2 or OsDXR caused no positive effect on the accumulation of either carotenoids or chlorophylls in leaves and seeds, suggesting that OsDXS2 functions as a rate-limiting enzyme supplying IPP/DMAPPs to seed carotenoid metabolism, but OsDXR doesn't in either leaves or seeds. The expressions of OsDXS1, OsPSY1, OsPSY2, and OsBCH2 genes were upregulated regardless of the reductions of chlorophylls and carotenoids in leaves; however, there was no significant change in the expression of most carotenogenic genes, even though there was a 315.3-fold increase in the amount of carotenoid in rice seeds. These non-proportional expression patterns in leaves and seeds suggest that those metabolic changes of carotenoids were associated with overexpression of the OsDXS2, OsDXR and stPAC transgenes, and the capacities of the intermediate biosynthetic enzymes might be much more important for those metabolic alterations than the transcript levels of intermediate biosynthetic genes are. Taken together, we propose a 'Three Faucets and Cisterns Model' about the relationship among the rate-limiting enzymes OsDXSs, OsPSYs, and OsBCHs as a Faucet, the biosynthetic capacity of intermediate metabolites as a Cistern, and the carotenoid accumulations as the content of Cistern. Conclusion Our study suggests that OsDXS2 plays an important role as a rate-limiting enzyme supplying IPP/DMAPPs to the seed-carotenoid accumulation, and rice seed carotenoid metabolism could be largely enhanced without any significant transcriptional alteration of carotenogenic genes. Finally, the Three Faucets and Cisterns model presents the extenuating circumstance to elucidate rice seed carotenoid metabolism.","[You, M. K.; Lee, Y. J.; Ha, S.

The MEP pathway is highly sensitive to environmental cues as many of these compounds are linked to photosynthesis and growth and light is one of the main regulatory factors. However, the mechanisms coordinating the MEP pathway with light cues are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that by a differential direct transcriptional modulation, via the key-master integrators of light signal transduction HY5 and PIFs which target the genes that encode the rate-controlling DXS1, DXR and HDR enzymes, light imposes a direct, rapid and potentially multi-faceted response that leads to unique protein dynamics of this pathway, resulting in a significant difference in the protein levels. For DXS1, PIF1/HY5 act as a direct activation/suppression module. In contrast, DXR accumulation in response to light results from HY5 induction with minor contribution of de-repression by PIF1. Finally, HDR transcription increases in the light exclusively by suppression of the PIFs repression. This is an example of how light signaling components can differentially multi-target the initial steps of a pathway whose products branch downstream to all chloroplastic isoprenoids. These findings demonstrate the diversity and flexibility of light signaling components that optimize key biochemical pathways essential for plant growth.","[Chenge-Espinosa, Marel; Cordoba, Elizabeth; Romero-Guido, Cynthia; Leon, Patricia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biotecnol, Dept Biol Mol Plantas, Ave Univ 2001, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico; [Toledo-Ortiz, Gabriela] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England",,"Leon, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biotecnol, Dept Biol Mol Plantas, Ave Univ 2001, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico.; Toledo-Ortiz, G (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",England,Europe,Global North,g.toledo-ortiz@lancaster.ac.uk; patricia@ibt.unam.mx,,"Toledo-Ortiz, Gabriela/0000-0003-4421-349X; Cordoba, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2217-7678","CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CB 220534, FC 2016-96]; DGAPA-UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN204617]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission [RG150711]; DGAPA; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)",We thank Dr. Nidia Sanchez and Dr. Gabriela Perez for technical assistance and Phoebe Sutton and Geoff Holroyd for proof-reading the manuscript.

Aromatic mint plants produce valuable essential oil in specialised glandular trichomes known as peltate glandular trichomes (PGT). Here, we performed next generation transcriptome sequencing of different tissues of Mentha spicata (spearmint) to identify differentially expressed transcripts specific to PGT. Our results provide a comprehensive overview of PGT's dynamic metabolic activities which will help towards pathway engineering. Results: Spearmint RNAs from 3 different tissues: PGT, leaf and leaf stripped of PGTs (leaf-PGT) were sequenced by Illumina paired end sequencing. The sequences were assembled de novo into 40,587 non-redundant unigenes; spanning a total of 101 Mb. Functions could be assigned to 27,025 (67%) unigenes and among these 3,919 unigenes were differentially expressed in PGT relative to leaf PGT. Lack of photosynthetic transcripts in PGT transcriptome indicated the high levels of purity of isolated PGT, as mint PGT are non-photosynthetic. A significant number of these unigenes remained unannotated or encoded hypothetical proteins. We found 16 terpene synthases (TPS), 18 cytochrome P450s, 5 lipid transfer proteins and several transcription factors that were preferentially expressed in PGT. Among the 16 TPSs, two were characterized biochemically and found to be sesquiterpene synthases. Conclusions: The extensive transcriptome data set renders a complete description of genes differentially expressed in spearmint PGT. This will facilitate the metabolic engineering of mint terpene pathway to increase yield and also enable the development of strategies for sustainable production of novel or altered valuable compounds in mint.","[Jin, Jingjing; Panicker, Deepa; Wang, Qian; Kim, Mi Jung; Yin, Jun-Lin; Jang, In-Cheol; Sarojam, Rajani] Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, Singapore 117604, Singapore; [Jin, Jingjing; Wong, Limsoon] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Singapore 117417, Singapore; [Jin, Jingjing; Liu, Jun; Chua, Nam-Hai] Rockefeller Univ, Plant Mol Biol Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Jang, In-Cheol] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore",,"Sarojam, R (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, 1 Res Link, Singapore 117604, Singapore.",Singapore,Asia,Global North,rajanis@tll.org.sg,"Wong, Limsoon/W-3611-2019; yin, junlin/AAJ-4522-2021; Wong, Limsoon/E-5033-2010","Wong, Limsoon/0000-0003-1241-5441; Wong, Limsoon/0000-0003-1241-5441; Jang, In-Cheol/0000-0001-9408-4273","Singapore National Research FoundationNational Research Foundation, Singapore [NRF-CRP8-2011-02]; Singapore Millennium FoundationSingapore Millennium Foundation; Singapore Ministry of Education Tier-2 grantMinistry of Education, Singapore [MOE2009-T2-2-004]","We thank Hufeng Zhou for helping with bioinformatics analysis.

HOOK.F.; EMISSION,"The pleasant fragrance of ylang ylang varieties (Cananga odorata) is mainly due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the flowers. Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to beta-thujene, sabinene, beta-pinene, and alpha-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to alpha-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, beta-ylangene, beta-copaene, and beta-cubebene. Additionally, the activities of the two sesqui-TPSs were confirmed in planta by transient expression of these TPS genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration.","[Jin, Jingjing; Kim, Mi Jung; Dhandapani, Savitha; Tjhang, Jessica Gambino; Yin, Jun-Lin; Sarojam, Rajani; Jang, In-Cheol] Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, Singapore 117604, Singapore; [Jin, Jingjing; Wong, Limsoon] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Singapore 117417, Singapore; [Dhandapani, Savitha; Jang, In-Cheol] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Chua, Nam-Hai] Rockefeller Univ, Plant Mol Biol Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA",,"Jang, IC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, 1 Res Link, Singapore 117604, Singapore.",Singapore,Asia,Global North,jangi@tll.org.sg,"Wong, Limsoon/E-5033-2010; yin, junlin/AAJ-4522-2021; Wong, Limsoon/W-3611-2019","Wong, Limsoon/0000-0003-1241-5441; Wong, Limsoon/0000-0003-1241-5441; Jang, In-Cheol/0000-0001-9408-4273; Dhandapani, Savitha/0000-0002-9177-6546","Singapore National Research Foundation (Competitive Research Programme Award)National Research Foundation, Singapore [NRF-CRP8-2011-02]; Singapore Ministry of Education Tier-2 grantMinistry of Education, Singapore [MOE2009-T2-2-004]","We thank the Rockefeller University sequencing facility and Dr Hui-Wen Wu for RNA-seq and the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory central facilities for support with confocal microscopy.

TwDXS is a prominent protein in the Tripterygium wilfordii proteome, with especially high expression in the root periderm. It is significantly regulated by methyl jasmonate. Here, we studied the influence of TwDXS expression on bioactive terpenoids in T. wilfordii. Specific fragments of TwDXS (GenBank: AKP20998.1) with lengths of 2148 and 437 bp were amplified to construct the overexpression (OE) and RNA-interference (RNAi) vectors, respectively. After transformation of suspension cells, the expression of TwDXS and genes related to the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway was measured using qRT-PCR. TwDXS mRNA level was 153 and 43% of the control in the OE and RNAi lines. Related genes in the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP), mevalonic acid (MVA) and downstream pathways showed similar trends to the changes of TwDXS expression. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) was employed to measure the accumulation of terpenoids. Importantly, the triptolide content showed significant differences in both the TwDXS OE (222.35% of the control) and RNAi (34.86% of the control). However, there were no obvious changes in the celastrol content. In this study, we verified that the expression of TwDXS affects triptolide but not celastrol in T. wilfordii via both TwDXS OE and RNAi experiments.","[Zhang, Yifeng; Wang, Jiadian; Hu, Tianyuan; Zhou, Jiawei; Gao, Jie; Gao, Wei] Capital Med Univ, Sch Tradit Chinese Med, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yifeng; Hu, Tianyuan; Tong, Yuru; Zhou, Jiawei; Gao, Wei] Capital Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yujun; Gao, Jie; Huang, Luqi] Chinese Acad Chinese Med Sci, Natl Resource Ctr Chinese Mat Med, State Key Lab Breeding Base Dao Di Herbs, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China; [Gao, Wei] Capital Med Univ, Adv Innovat Ctr Human Brain Protect, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China",,"Gao, W (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Sch Tradit Chinese Med, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China.; Gao, W (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China.; Gao, W (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Adv Innovat Ctr Human Brain Protect, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,weigao@ccmu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81773830]; Scientific Research Key Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of EducationBeijing Municipal Commission of Education [KZ201710025022]; High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan [CITTCD20170324]; Key Project at central government level: The ability establishment of sustainable use for valuable Chinese medicine resources [2060302]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation ProgramBeijing Natural Science Foundation,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81773830), Beijing Natural Science Foundation Program and Scientific Research Key Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education (KZ201710025022), High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan (CIT&TCD20170324), the Key Project at central government level: The ability establishment of sustainable use for valuable Chinese medicine resources (2060302).",32,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-9317,1399-3054,MAY,2020,169,1,10.1111/ppl.13051,Plant Sciences,LH6ZL,WOS:000500537200001,31758560,,

It has been suggested that isoprene improves thermotolerance by helping photosynthesis cope with high temperature. However, the evidence for the thermotolerance hypothesis is indirect and one of three methods used to support this hypothesis has recently been called into question. More direct evidence required new methods of controlling endogenous isoprene. An inhibitor of the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate pathway, the alternative pathway to the mevalonic acid pathway and the pathway by which isoprene is made, is now available. Fosmidomycin eliminates isoprene emission without affecting photosynthesis for several hours after feeding to detached leaves. Photosynthesis of fosmidomycin-fed leaves recovered less following a 2-min high-temperature treatment at 46 degreesC than did photosynthesis of leaves fed water or fosmidomycin-fed leaves in air supplemented with isoprene. Photosynthesis of Phaseolus vulgaris leaves, which do not make isoprene, exhibited increased thermotolerance when isoprene was supplied in the airstream flowing over the leaf. Other short-chain alkenes also improved thermotolerance, whereas alkanes reduced thermotolerance. It is concluded that thermotolerance of photosynthesis is a substantial benefit to plants that make isoprene and that this benefit explains why plants make isoprene. The effect may be a general hydrocarbon effect and related to the double bonds in the isoprene molecule.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Sharkey, TD (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,,"Sharkey, Thomas D/B-4032-2009; Sharkey, Thomas/ABF-1317-2020","Sharkey, Thomas D/0000-0002-4423-3223; Sharkey, Thomas/0000-0002-4423-3223",,,39,172,AMER SOC PLANT PHYSIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,APR,2001,125,4,10.1104/pp.125.4.2001,Plant Sciences,424CU,WOS:000168215200047,11299379,"Green Published, Bronze",

Leaves of Populus nigra and Phragmites australis exposed to (CO2)-C-13 for 15 min emitted isoprene that was about 90% C-13, but DMAPP isolated from those leaves was only 28% and 36% C-13, respectively. The labeled DMAPP is likely to represent chloroplastic DMAPP contributing to isoprene emission. A substantial C-13 labeling was also found in both emission and DMAPP pool of low-emitting, young leaves of Phragmites. This confirms that low emission of young leaves is not caused by absence of chloroplastic DMAPP but rather by enzyme characteristics. A very low C-13 labeling was found in the DMAPP pool and in the residual isoprene emission of leaves previously fed with fosmidomycin to inhibit isoprene formation. This shows that fosmidomycin is a very effective inhibitor of the chloroplastic biosynthetic pathway of isoprene synthesis, that the residual isoprene is formed from extra-chloroplastic sources, and that chloroplastic and extrachloroplastic pathways are not cross-linked, at least following inhibition of the chloroplastic pathway Refixation of unlabeled respiratory CO, in the light may explain incomplete labeling of isoprene emission, as we found a good association between these two parameters.","CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale & Forestale, I-00016 Rome, Italy; CNR, Ist Metodol Chim, I-00016 Rome, Italy",,"Loreto, F (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale & Forestale, I-00016 Rome, Italy.",Italy,Europe,Global North,francesco.loreto@ibaf.cnr.it,"Loreto, Francesco/B-7477-2015","Loreto, Francesco/0000-0002-9171-2681",,,25,61,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,AUG,2004,135,4,10.1104/pp.104.039537,Plant Sciences,848QO,WOS:000223482400005,15286296,"Bronze, Green Published",

Metabolic engineering of Stevia would offer an alternative approach to conventional breeding for enhanced production of SGs. However, an effective protocol for Stevia transformation is lacking.ResultsHere, we present an efficient and reproducible method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Stevia. In our attempts to produce transgenic Stevia plants, we found that prolonged dark incubation is critical for increasing shoot regeneration. Etiolated shoots regenerated in the dark also facilitated subsequent visual selection of transformants by green fluorescent protein during Stevia transformation. Using this newly established transformation method, we overexpressed the Stevia 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1 (SrDXS1) and kaurenoic acid hydroxylase (SrKAH), both of which are required for SGs biosynthesis. Compared to control plants, the total SGs content in SrDXS1- and SrKAH-overexpressing transgenic lines were enhanced by up to 42-54% and 67-88%, respectively, showing a positive correlation with the expression levels of SrDXS1 and SrKAH. Furthermore, their overexpression did not stunt the growth and development of the transgenic Stevia plants.ConclusionThis study represents a successful case of genetic manipulation of SGs biosynthetic pathway in Stevia and also demonstrates the potential of metabolic engineering towards producing Stevia with improved SGs yield.","[Zheng, Junshi; Zhuang, Yan; Mao, Hui-Zhu; Jang, In-Cheol] Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, 1 Res Link, Singapore 117604, Singapore; [Zheng, Junshi; Jang, In-Cheol] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117558, Singapore",,"Jang, IC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, 1 Res Link, Singapore 117604, Singapore.; Jang, IC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117558, Singapore.",Singapore,Asia,Global North,jangi@tll.org.sg,,"Jang, In-Cheol/0000-0001-9408-4273; Zheng, Junshi/0000-0002-5823-2707",Temasek Life Sciences LaboratoryNational University of Singapore,"This work was supported by Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory.

We hypothesized that losing the capacity to produce isoprene would require stronger up-regulation of other stress tolerance mechanisms at low CO2 than at higher CO2 concentrations. We compared metabolite profiles and physiological performance in poplars (Populusxcanescens) with either wild-type or RNAi-suppressed isoprene emission capacity grown at pre-industrial low, current atmospheric, and future high CO2 concentrations (190, 390 and 590ppm CO2, respectively). Suppression of isoprene biosynthesis led to significant rearrangement of the leaf metabolome, increasing stress tolerance responses such as xanthophyll cycle pigment de-epoxidation and antioxidant levels, as well as altering lipid, carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Metabolic and physiological differences between isoprene-emitting and suppressed lines diminished as growth CO2 concentrations rose. The CO2 dependence of our results indicates that the effects of isoprene biosynthesis are strongest at pre-industrial CO2 concentrations. Rising CO2 may reduce the beneficial effects of biogenic isoprene emission, with implications for species competition. This has potential consequences for future climate warming, as isoprene emitted from vegetation has strong effects on global atmospheric chemistry.","[Way, Danielle A.; Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Way, Danielle A.; Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Way, Danielle A.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Ghirardo, Andrea; Schnitzler, Joerg-Peter] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Biochem Plant Pathol, Res Unit Environm Simulat, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Kanawati, Basem; Schmitt-Kopplin, Philippe] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Res Unit Biogeochem & Analyt, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Esperschuetz, Juergen] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Soil Ecol, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Esperschuetz, Juergen] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Res Unit Environm Genom, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Monson, Russell K.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Monson, Russell K.] Univ Arizona, Tree Ring Res Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Way, DA (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,dway4@uwo.ca,"Way, Danielle/AAY-6395-2021; Way, Danielle A/N-1867-2014; Schnitzler, Joerg-Peter/C-5268-2011; Schmitt-Kopplin, Philippe/H-6271-2011; Ghirardo, Andrea/P-1764-2019","Way, Danielle/0000-0003-4801-5319; Way, Danielle A/0000-0003-4801-5319; Schnitzler, Joerg-Peter/0000-0002-9825-867X; Schmitt-Kopplin, Philippe/0000-0003-0824-2664; Ghirardo, Andrea/0000-0003-1973-4007","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; US Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2011-67003-30222]; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0006967, DE-FG02-95ER62083]; US-Israeli Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2010320]; Human Frontier Science Programme (HFSP)Human Frontier Science Program","The authors thank Will Cook and the Duke Phytotron staff for their assistance in growing the plants and the biostatistician Hagen Scherb for useful discussions on statistical approaches.

The effects of the ionic liquid 1-ethylpyridinium bromide ([EtPy][Br]), which prefers to react with lignin rather than cellulose on the wood cell walls of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), were investigated from a morphology and topochemistry point of view. The [EtPy][Br] treatment induced cell wall swelling, the elimination of warts, and the formation of countless pores in the tracheids. However, many of the pit membranes and the cellulose crystalline structure remained unchanged.

Accumulation of 1-SST mRNA occurred at the onset of thickening, indicating that 1-SST is controlled at a transcriptional level. Acid invertase activity gradually increased during phase I and remained high during early phase II. It subsequently decreased. The pattern of invertase mRNA accumulation correlated with the enzyme activities, indicating that acid invertase Is controlled at the transcriptional level.

The soluble solids content (SSC) was higher in the preharvest 1-MCP-treated fruit than in untreated fruit at harvest and during the second half of the shelf-life period after cold storage. However, preharvest 1-MCP treatment aggravated the incidence and severity of flesh browning. The contents of asparagine, histidine, valine, and isoleucine were higher in the preharvest 1-MCP-treated fruit than in the untreated fruit during the shelf-life period after cold storage. The results of principal component analysis loading plot indicated that preharvest 1-MCP treatment was strongly associated with leucine, tryptophan, histidine, valine, and isoleucine. In addition, the results of Pearson's correlation coefficient networking indicated that preharvest 1-MCP treatment affected the differential responses of fruit quality attributes and targeted metabolites during the shelf-life period after cold storage.

In this study, we determined the residual effect of 1-MCP and how it is affected by temperature. The efficacy of multiple applications of 1-MCP was also investigated. The residual effect of 1-MCP was determined by pretreating blooming Phalaenopsis amabilis plants with 0.8 mu L.L-1 1-MCP for 8 hours on Day 0 followed by 2 mu L-L-1 ethylene fumigation for 12 hours on designated days. Without 1-MCP pretreatment, flowers began to wilt within 2 days after exposure to ethylene. Duration of the residual protection of 1-MCP on P. amabilis was approximate to 6 to 8 days during summer in Taiwan. Lower temperatures after 1-MCP application prolonged protection times. The full protection times under day/night temperatures of 25/20, 20/15, and 15/13 degrees C were 4 to 8, 10 to 13, and 13 to 17 days, respectively.

After ethylene exposure, plants were either destructively harvested for root measurements or forced in a greenhouse for flower measurements. Ethylene exposure at concentrations as low as 1 mu L.L-1 during the first week of growth reduced shoot and root elongation and subsequently increased flower bud abortion.

We examined ethylene receptors MdERS1 and MdERS2 in 1-MCP-treated and untreated fruit and leaves of cultivar 'Orin' and 'Fuji' apples. MdERS1 and MdERS2 transcription increased rapidly after harvest in control fruit, but in 1-MCP-treated fruit, increases were delayed for 30 days. However, MdERS1 and MdERS2 protein levels behaved differently. MdERS1 decreased gradually in both the control and 1-MCP treatments. MdERS2, however, increased gradually in control 'Fuji' and remained steady in 1-MCP-treated 'Fuji' but remained low in 'Orin'. Exogenous ethylene treatment of fruit increased MdERS1 and MdERS2 expression with slightly decreased protein levels. The ratios of proteins to mRNAs were much lower in 'Orin' fruit, and they decreased with ethylene treatment in both cultivars. However, protein to transcript ratio was higher in 'Fuji' ethylene treated fruit than in air- and ethylene-treated 'Orin' fruit. MdERS1 and MdERS2 transcript levels were increased by exogenous ethylene treatment in air pre-treated leaves, but MdERS1 and MdERS2 protein levels did not change or decrease with ethylene treatment, and the ratio of protein to mRNA was lower in ethylene-treated leaves. Differences between transcription and protein levels may be due to receptor turnover differences in the presence or absence of ethylene.

In addition, 1-MCP maintained antioxidant enzymes activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) of bitter melon at initial stage but suppressed at the subsequent shelf life.

The fruit is sensitive to storage and transportation conditions and presents a major problem in its commercialization. The present study was conducted to investigate the regulation of gene expression involved in plant hormone signaling pathway in the Chinese bayberry with different treatments of heat and 1-methylcyclopene (1 MCP) during postharvest storage. In one treatment group (HM group), we exposed Chinese bayberry fruit to 48 degrees C for 10 min and then sealed them in a desiccator with 5 mu.L-1 of 1-MCP for 24 hat 20 degrees C, followed by storage at 10 degrees C. Another group (CK group) was directly stored at 10 degrees C without any prior treatment. Samples of fruit were collected every three days, at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 d (CK3, CK6, CK9, CK12 and CK15; and HM3, HM6, HM9, HM12, and HM15, respectively). The decay index of fruits in the CK group increased after six days of storage but did not increase until nine days of storage in the HM group. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the CK group was shown a downtrend during storage, and almost no fluctuation from six days. In the HM group, SOD activity increased after three days, but decreased sharply after six days storage. Besides, peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities were shown the similar trend during the storage, both of them first increased and then decreased form the six days of storage. These physiological data indicated that the sixth day is a crucial time during the storage of Chinese bayberry treated with heat and 1-MCP. Therefore, the transcriptome libraries were constructed from CKO, CK6, HM6 group, respectively. The analysis of top 20 KEGG pathways showed that most differentially expressed genes were involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, particularly flavonoids and flavanols biosynthesis, in CKO vs. CK6 and CKO vs. HM6. However, the top three KEGG pathways in CK6 vs. HM6 were the ribosome, RNA transport and endocytosis during the storage. Expression of six ethylene receptor (ETR) genes and four ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF) genes were activated at transcriptional level during the postharvest stage and were decreased by heat and 1-MCP treatment, and serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (Wail) was also repressed by treatment. Abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element binding factor (ABF) gene, auxin-responsive GH3 gene and transcription factor MYC2 gene also showed similar expression pattern with ethylene pathway genes. These results might improve our understanding of the mechanisms of heat and 1 MCP inhibition of fruit postharvest physiology and prolongation of fruit shelf life.","[Shi, Ting; Sun, Jie; Wu, Xinxin; Weng, Jinyang; Gao, Zhihong] Nanjing Agr Univ, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jie; Wang, Pengkai; Qie, Hongli; Huang, Yinghong; Wang, Huakun] Taihu Extens Ctr Evergreen Fruit Jiangsu Prov, Suzhou 215107, Peoples R China",,"Gao, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,gaozhihong@njau.edu.cn,,"Shi, Ting/0000-0002-0955-016X","Jiangsu Province Science Technology Independent Innovation Fund [CX (16)1014]; Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province [NY068]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KJQN201653]; Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds [2018K216C]; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory for Plant Epigenetics (College of Life Sciences and Oceanography, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, P.R.

Fruit of many apple cultivars can be stored for an extended period due to the introduction of advanced storage technologies, such as controlled atmosphere (CA) and 1-methylcyclopropane (1-MCP). However, CA storage can cause external CO2 injury for some apple cultivars. The molecular changes associated with the development of CO2 injury are not well elucidated. In this study, the global transcriptional regulations were investigated under different storage conditions and during development of CO2 injury symptoms on 'Golden Delicious' fruit. Fruit peel tissues under three different storage regimens, regular cold atmosphere, CA and CA storage and 1-MCP application were sampled at four storage durations over a 12-week period. Fruit physiological changes were affected differently under these storage regimens, and CO2 injury symptoms were detectable 2 weeks after CA storage. Identification of the differentially expressed genes and a gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed the specific transcriptome changes associated with each storage regimen. Overall, a profound transcriptome change was associated with CA storage regimen as indicated by the large number of differentially expressed genes. The lighter symptom was accompanied by reduced transcriptome changes under the CA storage and 1-MCP application regimen. Furthermore, the higher enrichment levels in the functional categories of oxidative stress response, glycolysis and protein post-translational modification were only associated with CA storage regime; therefore, these processes potentially contribute to the development of external CO2 injury or its symptom in apple.","[Johnson, Franklin T.] Washington State Univ, Dept Hort, Pullman, WA 98664 USA; [Zhu, Yanmin] USDA ARS, Tree Fruit Res Lab, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA",,"Zhu, YM (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Tree Fruit Res Lab, 1104 N Western Ave, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,yanmin.zhu@ars.usda.gov,,,ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service [ARS-0426043] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER,,49,4,NANJING AGRICULTURAL UNIV,NANJING,"NO 1 WEIGANG, NANJING, JIANGSU 210095, PEOPLES R CHINA",2662-6810,2052-7276,23-Dec,2015,2,,10.1038/hortres.2015.61,Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Horticulture,CZ6CH,WOS:000367188200001,27087982,"gold, Green Published",

However, unsuitable1-MCP treatment can cause fruit ripening disorders.ResultsIn this study, we show that short-term 1-MCP treatment (400nL center dot L-1, 2h) significantly delays papaya fruit ripening with normal ripening characteristics. However, long-term 1-MCP treatment (400nL center dot L-1, 16h) causes a rubbery texture of fruit. The comparative transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 5529 genes were differently expressed during fruit ripening compared to freshly harvested fruits. Comprehensive functional enrichment analysis showed that the metabolic pathways of carbon metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, biosynthesis of amino acids, and starch and sucrose metabolism are involved in fruit ripening. 1-MCP treatment significantly affected fruit transcript levels. A total of 3595 and 5998 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between short-term 1-MCP, long-term 1-MCP treatment and the control, respectively. DEGs are mostly enriched in the similar pathway involved in fruit ripening. A large number of DEGs were also identified between long-term and short-term 1-MCP treatment, with most of the DEGs being enriched in carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and biosynthesis of amino acids. The 1-MCP treatments accelerated the lignin accumulation and delayed cellulose degradation during fruit ripening. Considering the rubbery phenotype, we inferred that the cell wall metabolism and hormone signal pathways are closely related to papaya fruit ripening disorder. The RNA-Seq output was confirmed using RT-qPCR by 28 selected genes that were involved in cell wall metabolism and hormone signal pathways.ConclusionsThese results showed that long-term 1-MCP treatment severely inhibited ethylene signaling and the cell wall metabolism pathways, which may result in the failure of cell wall degradation and fruit softening. Our results reveal multiple ripening-associated events during papaya fruit ripening and provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying 1-MCP treatment on fruit ripening and the regulatory networks.","[Zhu, Xiaoyang; Ye, Lanlan; Ding, Xiaochun; Gao, Qiyang; Xiao, Shuangling; Tan, Qinqin; Huang, Jiling; Chen, Weixin; Li, Xueping] South China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Subtrop Agrobi, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Postharvest Sci Fruits & V, Coll Hort, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Li, XP (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Subtrop Agrobi, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Postharvest Sci Fruits & V, Coll Hort, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,xiaoyang_zhu@scau.edu.cn; lxp88@scau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31701970, 31372112]; Characteristic Innovation Project of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education [2017KTSCX017]; Pearl River Talent Program for Young Talent [2017GC010321]; College Students' Science and Technology Innovation Cultivation Special Funds Program of Guangdong Province [pdjhb0089]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants no. 31701970, 31372112), The Characteristic Innovation Project of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education (grant no. 2017KTSCX017), Pearl River Talent Program for Young Talent (grant no. 2017GC010321) and College Students' Science and Technology Innovation Cultivation Special Funds Program of Guangdong Province (grant no.pdjhb0089).

However, previous work had shown that ethylene is capable of affecting the physiological processes during maturation of grape berries. Experiments were designed to screen the gene pool affected by ethylene at the ripening inception in Cabernet Sauvignon berries. The results showed that only 73 of 14 562 genes of microarray slides were significantly modulated by a 24-h ethylene treatment (4 mu l l(-1)), performed 8 weeks after flowering. The study then focused on accumulation of several mRNAs affected by ethylene in relation to the berry size. Indeed, we observed that ethylene application at veraison led to a berry diameter increase. This increase is mainly because of sap intake and cell wall modifications, enabling cell elongation. This was related to changes in the expression pattern of many genes, classified in two groups: (1) 'water exchange' genes: various aquaporins (AQUA) and (2) 'cell wall structure' genes: polygalacturonases, xyloglucan endotransglucosylases (XTH), pectin methyl esterases, cellulose synthases and expansins. The expression patterns were followed either along berry development or in three berry tissues (peel, pulp and seeds). Ethylene stimulates the accumulation of most gene transcripts in 1 h, and in several parts of the berry, this stimulation may last for 24 h in some cases. One XTH and one AQUA seem to be good candidates to explain the ethylene-induced berry expansion. This work brings more clues about the ethylene involvement in the development and ripening of grape berries.","[Chervin, Christian; Tira-umphon, Arak; Zouine, Mohamed; Roustan, Jean-Paul] Univ Toulouse, INRA, INP ENSAT, UMR Genom & Biotechnol Fruits 990, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Terrier, Nancy] INRA, UMR Sci Oenol, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Severac, Dany] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Genom Fonctionnelle, CNRS, INSERM,U661,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France",,"Chervin, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, INRA, INP ENSAT, UMR Genom & Biotechnol Fruits 990, BP 32607, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",France,Europe,Global North,chervin@ensat.fr,"CHERVIN, Christian/AAJ-6114-2020; Chervin, Christian/AAW-5188-2020","CHERVIN, Christian/0000-0002-0913-6815;",,,36,105,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-9317,1399-3054,NOV,2008,134,3,10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01158.x,Plant Sciences,358JQ,WOS:000259913400015,18785902,,

Because the development of these physiological disorders in other cultivars can be influenced by humidity during storage, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of high storage humidity on fruit quality attributes and incidence of physiological disorders in cold-stored 'Royal Gala' apples. Fruit obtained from a commercial orchard were kept in cardboard boxes with or without a perforated polyethylene liner during and after cold storage. High storage humidity induced by the perforated polyethylene liner reduced fresh weight loss but enhanced the change of fruit circumference after cold storage. High storage humidity contributed the most reduction of cortex lightness (L*) and hue angle (h(o)) in stem-end cortex tissues during shelf life. Fruit stored with liners had reduced internal ethylene concentration (IEC) and outer cortex firmness after removal from storage compared with control fruit. Furthermore, high storage humidity prevented shriveling but provoked fruit cracking. The incidence and severity of flesh breakdown were further aggravated during shelf life, compared with cold storage, regardless of a liner application. Overall, maintaining high storage humidity by applying a perforated polyethylene liner can contribute to delaying fresh weight loss, reducing IEC, and preventing fruit shriveling but can enhance cortex tissue browning, loss of flesh firmness, and incidence of fruit cracking during cold storage and shelf life.","[Lee, Jinwook] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Integrat Plant Sci, Anseong 17546, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Mattheis, James P.; Rudell, David R.] USDA ARS, Tree Fruit Res Lab, 1104 North Western Ave, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA",,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Integrat Plant Sci, Anseong 17546, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",South Korea,Asia,Global North,JL425@cau.ac.kr,,"Lee, Jinwook/0000-0001-6547-2509","AgroFresh, Inc.","Financial support for this research was received from AgroFresh, Inc.",,7,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,JAN,2019,54,1,10.21273/HORTSCI13406-18,Horticulture,,Agriculture,,gold,

The incidence of external CO2 injury was usually greater with higher storage temperature, whereas flesh browning was worst at lower storage temperatures and senescent breakdown was higher at warmer storage temperatures. The effect of storage temperature on core browning was not consistent. External CO2 injury, flesh browning, and core browning incidences were higher with increasing pCO(2), especially above 2 kPa. Flesh firmness was lowest at warmer storage temperatures and in the absence of CO2. Orchard to orchard variation for all factors was high. Relationships of disorders with mineral concentrations were specific to disorder and storage conditions. The results suggest that 'Empire' should be stored at 1 to 2 degrees C, reflecting a compromise between risk of flesh browning at 0 degrees C and risk of senescent breakdown and unacceptably soft fruit at 3 degrees C and that pCO(2) should be maintained below 2 kPa and closer to 1 kPa.","[Watkins, C.

The linolenic content in soybean seed is controlled by three fatty acid desaturase (FAD) three enzymes, FAD3A, B, and C. The soybean lines with 1 % linolenic acid content which are widely used in breeding for reduced linolenic acid in the USA have mutations in each of the three FAD genes derived from lines A5 (deletion of FAD3A), A26, and A23 (missense mutations in FAD3B and C, respectively). Although soybean line A5 has been released for 30 years, the extent and definition of the deletion of the FAD3A gene has not been characterized, which has prevented researchers from designing robust molecular markers for effective marker-assisted selection (MAS). Using a PCR-based genomic strategy, we have identified a 6.4-kbp deletion of the FAD3A gene in A5 and developed a TaqMan detection assay by targeting the deletion junction in A5, which could be used to distinguish the homozygotes and heterozygotes of the gene. In addition, based on mutant single nucleotide polymorphisms in FAD3B and FAD3C identified in A26 and A23, respectively, we have also developed TaqMan assays for high-throughput MAS. The TaqMan assays have proven to be a very effective platform for detecting the mutant FAD3 alleles and thus will greatly facilitate high-throughput MAS for development of soybean lines with reduced linolenic acid content.","[Pham, Anh-Tung; Boerma, H.

Oxidation of these model xenobiotics has also been assessed in a reconstituted electron-transport chain with a partially purified CYP fraction, phospholipid and isolated tulip NADPH:CYP reductase (EC 1.6.2.4.). Peroxidase isolated from tulip bulbs (isoenzyme C) oxidizes these xenobiotics, too. Values of kinetic parameters (K-m, V-max), requirements for cofactors (NADPH, hydrogen peroxide), the effect of inhibitors and identification of products formed from the xenobiotics by the microsomal fraction, partially purified CYP and peroxidase C were determined. These data were used to estimate the participation of the CYP preparation and peroxidase C in oxidation of two out of the four studied xenobiotics (NMA, Sudan I) in tulip microsomes. Using such detailed study, we found that the CYP-dependent enzyme system is responsible for the oxidation of these xenobiotics in the microsomal fraction of tulip bulbs.

Real-time quantification polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis has revealed that JcMIPS transcripts are highly present in seed and leaf tissues, but are at low levels in stem and flower tissues. Furthermore, the transcription of JcMIPS in leaves is up-regulated by abscisic acid (ABA) (100 mu M), drought (30% PEG-6000), NaCl (200 mM), and low-temperature (4A degrees C) treatments. The observed increase of JcMIPS enzyme activity is also detected following treatments with ABA, drought, and NaCl.

Inositol can be converted into phytic acid (phytate), the most abundant form of phosphate in seeds. The path to phytate has been suggested to proceed via the sequential phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, and/or in part via phosphatidylinositol phosphate. Soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Myo-inositol phosphates, including phytic acid, play diverse roles in plants as signal transduction molecules, osmoprotectants, and cell wall constituents. D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (MIPS EC 5.5.1.4) catalyzes the first step in de novo synthesis of myo-inositol. A soybean (Glycine max) MIPS cDNA (GmMIPS1) was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using consensus primers designed from highly conserved regions in other plant MIPS sequences. Southern-blot analysis and database searches indicated the presence of at least four MIPS genes in the soybean genome. Northern-blot and immunoblot analyses indicated higher MIPS expression and accumulation in immature seeds than in other soybean tissues. MIPS was expressed early in the cotyledonary stage of seed development. The GmMIPS1 expression pattern suggested that it encodes a MIPS isoform that functions in seeds to generate D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate as a substrate for phytic acid biosynthesis.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol Physiol & Weed Sci, Fralin Biotechnol Ctr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",,"Grabau, EA (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol Physiol & Weed Sci, Fralin Biotechnol Ctr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,,,,,,27,91,AMER SOC PLANT PHYSIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,APR,2001,125,4,10.1104/pp.125.4.1941,Plant Sciences,424CU,WOS:000168215200041,11299373,"Bronze, Green Published",

Therefore, production practices reducing MBr use are desirable from the grower and environmental standpoints. Fumigation efficacy depends on the duration of fumigants in the soil and mulch permeability; thus, field trials were conducted to compare MBr retention of low- and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE respectively) mulches with seven metallized mulches and virtually impermeable films (VIF) from different manufacturers, and to assess the effect of MBr retention on nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus and C escutentus) control with these mulches. The compared mulches were 1) white VIF; 2) black VIF; 3) white-on-black VIF; 4) cowound VIF, which has a clear nylon layer that covers the bed and is superimposed with a layer of black HDPE mulch; 5) metallized; 6) metallized heat trap with a black stripe on the bed center; 7) metallized with a black stripe on the bed center; 8) black LDPE mulch; and 9) black HDPE mulch. All treatments received 175 lb/acre of MBr + chloropicrin (Pic; 67:33 v/v). A nonfumigated control plot covered with LDPE mulch, and a treatment covered with HDPE mulch and fumigated with 350 lb/acre of MBr + Pic were also established. Nutsedge emergence through mulches increased rapidly beginning 18 days after treatment (DAT). Nutsedge populations at 28 DAT in the nonfumigated control covered with LDPE mulch had the greatest emergence (88.8 plants/ft(2)), followed by LDPE and HDPE mulches with 175 lb/acre of MBr + Pic (67.0 plants/ft(2)), HDPE mulch with 350 lb/acre of MBr + Pic (25.0 plants/ft), and VIF and metallized mulches with 175 lb/acre of MBr + Pic (< 2 plants/ft(2)). There were no significant differences in fumigant retention between the metallized mulches and VIF.

Various approaches employed to address the micronutrient bioavailability are showing promising signs, especially in cereal crops. Phytic acid (PA) is considered as a major antinutrient due to its ability to chelate important micronutrients and thereby restricting their bioavailability. Therefore, manipulating PA biosynthesis pathway has largely been explored to overcome the pleiotropic effect in different crop species. Recently, we reported that functional wheat inositol pentakisphosphate kinase (TaIPK1) is involved in PA biosynthesis, however, the functional roles of the IPK1 gene in wheat remains elusive. In this study, RNAi-mediated gene silencing was performed for IPK1 transcripts in hexaploid wheat. Four non-segregating RNAi lines of wheat were selected for detailed study (S3-D-6-1; S6-K-3-3; S6-K-6-10 and S16-D-9-5). Homozygous transgenic RNAi lines at T-4 seeds with a decreased transcript of TaIPK1 showed 28-56% reduction of the PA. Silencing of IPK1 also resulted in increased free phosphate in mature grains. Although, no phenotypic changes in the spike was observed but, lowering of grain PA resulted in the reduced number of seeds per spikelet. The lowering of grain PA was also accompanied by a significant increase in iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) content, thereby enhancing their molar ratios (Zn: PA and Fe: PA). Overall, this work suggests that IPK1 is a promising candidate for employing genome editing tools to address the mineral accumulation in wheat grains.","[Aggarwal, Sipla; Kumar, Anil; Bhati, Kaushal K.; Kaur, Gazaldeep; Shukla, Vishnu; Tiwari, Siddharth; Pandey, Ajay K.] Natl Agrifood Biotechnol Inst, Dept Biotechnol, Mohali, India; [Aggarwal, Sipla] Panjab Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Chandigarh, India; [Bhati, Kaushal K.] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen Plant Sci Ctr, PLEN, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Pandey, AK (corresponding author), Natl Agrifood Biotechnol Inst, Dept Biotechnol, Mohali, India.",India,Asia,Global South,pandeyak@nabi.res.in,"Shukla, Vishnu/Y-5518-2019; Bhati, Kaushal Kumar/R-1850-2019; Tiwari, Siddharth/AAC-5135-2020; shukla, vishnu/AAI-3807-2021","Bhati, Kaushal Kumar/0000-0002-2322-0431; Tiwari, Siddharth/0000-0003-3958-8465; shukla, vishnu/0000-0002-2778-0719; Pandey, Ajay Kumar/0000-0003-1064-139X","Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of IndiaDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) India [BT/PR5989/AGII/106/867/2012]; ICMRIndian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); NABI-CORE; CSIRCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India","The authors would like to thank Executive Director, NABI for facilities and support.

Here, we report the molecular cloning of a cDNA (AtIpk2beta) from a higher plant, Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis AtIpk2beta is a 33-kD protein that exhibits weak homology (similar to25% identical amino acids) with Ipk proteins from animals and yeast and lacks a calmodulin binding site, as revealed by sequence analysis and calmodulin binding assays. However, recombinant AtIpk2beta phosphorylates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate and also converts it to inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate [Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P-5]. AtIpk2beta also phosphorylates inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P-5. Thus, the enzyme is a D3/D6 dual-specificity inositol phosphate kinase. AtIpk2beta complements a yeast ARG82/IPK2 mutant lacking a functional ArgR-Mcm1 transcription complex. This complex is involved in regulating Arg metabolism-related gene expression and requires inositol polyphosphate kinase activity to function. AtIpk2beta was found to be located predominantly in the nucleus of plant cells, as demonstrated by immunolocalization and fusion to green fluorescent protein. RNA gel blot analysis and promoter-beta-glucuronidase reporter gene studies demonstrated AtIpk2beta gene expression in various organs tested. These data suggest a role for AtIpk2beta as a transcriptional control mediator in plants.","Max Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14424 Potsdam, Germany; Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds Inst Biotechnol & Agr, Ctr Plant Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",,"Mueller-Roeber, B (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Karl Liebknecht Str 25,Haus 20, D-14476 Golm Potsdam, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,,"Mueller-Roeber, Bernd/Z-4052-2019; FROMM, HILLEL/AAF-6783-2019","FROMM, HILLEL/0000-0003-1977-1211; Brearley, Charles/0000-0001-6179-9109",,,78,67,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",1040-4651,,FEB,2003,15,2,10.1105/tpc.006676,Plant Sciences,645YU,WOS:000181008700012,12566584,"Bronze, Green Published",Bronze

However, little is known about its physiological functions in higher plants. Here, we report that AtIpk2 beta regulates Arabidopsis axillary shoot branching. By overexpressing AtIpk2 beta in the wild type and mutants, we found that overexpression of AtIpk2 beta leads to more axillary shoot branches. Further analysis of AtIpk2 beta overexpression lines showed that axillary meristem forms earlier and the bud outgrowth rate is also accelerated, resulting in more axillary shoot branches. The AtIpk2 beta promoter/beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion (AtIpk2 beta::TGUS) expression pattern is similar to that of the auxin reporter DR5::TGUS. Moreover, AtIpk2 beta can be induced in response to exogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) treatments. In addition, AtIpk2 beta overexpression plants exhibit IAA-related phenotypes and are more resistant to exogenous IAA treatments. Further analysis employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction shows that some genes, including auxin-biosynthesis (CYP83B1), auxin-transport (PIN4), and auxin-mediated branching genes (MAX4 and SPS), are regulated by AtIpk2 beta. Taken together, our data provide insights into a role for AtIpk2 beta in axillary shoot branching through the auxin signaling pathway.","Wuhan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab MOE Plant Dev Biol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany",,"Xia, HJ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab MOE Plant Dev Biol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,hjxia@whu.edu.cn,,,,,71,44,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,JUN,2007,144,2,10.1104/pp.106.092163,Plant Sciences,176HH,WOS:000247075000037,17434984,"Green Published, hybrid",

Inositol 5 ' phosphatases (5PTases) are enzymes that remove a 5 ' phosphate from several potential second messengers, including IP3. In catalyzing the removal of a 5 ' phosyhate from second messenger substrates, 5PTases can act to terminate signal transduction events. We describe the molecular analysis of At5PTasel, a 5PTase gene from Arabidopsis. When expressed transiently in Arabidopsis leaf tissue or ectopically in transgenic plants, At5PTasel allowed for the increased hydrolysis of I(1,4,5)P-3 and I(1,3,4,5)P-4 substrates. At5PTase1 did not hydrolyze I(1)P, I(1,4)P-2, or PI(4,5)P-2 substrates. This substrate specificity was similar to that of the human Type I 5PTase. We identified 14 other potential At5PTase genes and constructed an unrooted phylogenetic tree containing putative Arabidopsis, human, and yeast 5PTase proteins. This analysis indicated that the Arabidopsis 5PTases were grouped in two separate branches of the tree. The multiplicity of At5PTases indicates that these enzymes may have different substrate specificities and play different roles in signal termination in Arabidopsis.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biochem, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Fralin Biotechnol Ctr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Gillaspy, GE (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biochem, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,,"Gruissem, Wilhelm/H-1752-2013; Kudla, Jörg/C-2174-2012","Kudla, Jörg/0000-0002-8238-767X; Gruissem, Wilhelm/0000-0002-1872-2998",,,39,85,AMER SOC PLANT PHYSIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,JUN,2001,126,2,10.1104/pp.126.2.801,Plant Sciences,442QT,WOS:000169297000036,11402208,"Bronze, Green Published",

Analysis of CO(2) response curves of photosynthesis of the mutant, which has normal Kranz anatomy but lacks a functional C(4) cycle, provided a direct means of determining the liquid phase-diffusive resistance of atmospheric CO(2) to sites of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation inside bundle sheath (BS) chloroplasts (r(bs)) within intact plants. Comparisons were made with excised shoots of wild-type plants fed 3,3-dichloro-2-(dihydroxyphosphinoylmethyl)-propenoate, an inhibitor of PEPC. Values of r(bs) in A. edulis were 70 to 180 m(2) s(-1) mol(-1), increasing as the leaf matured. This is about 70-fold higher than the liquid phase resistance for diffusion of CO(2) to Rubisco in mesophyll cells of C(3) plants. The values of r(bs) in A. edulis are sufficient for C(4) photosynthesis to elevate CO(2) in BS cells and to minimize photorespiration. The calculated CO(2) concentration in BS cells, which is dependent on input of r(bs), was about 2,000,bar under maximum rates of CO(2) fixation, which is about six times the ambient level of CO(2). High re-assimilation of photorespired CO(2) was demonstrated in both mutant and wild-type plants at limiting CO(2) concentrations, which can be explained by high r(bs). Increasing O(2) from near zero up to ambient levels under low CO(2), resulted in an increase in the gross rate of O(2) evolution measured by chlorophyll fluorescence analysis in the PEPC mutant; this increase was simulated from a Rubisco kinetic model, which indicates effective refixation of photorespired CO(2) in BS cells.","Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Univ Lancaster, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England",,"Edwards, GE (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,edwardsg@wsu.edu,,,,,38,45,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,OCT,2002,130,2,10.1104/pp.008201,Plant Sciences,605BC,WOS:000178654700040,12376660,"Bronze, Green Published",

Alongside carboxylating the five-carbon sugar ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP)(1-3), Rubisco produces a small amount of xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate (XuBP), a potent inhibitor of Rubisco(4). The AAA+ protein Rubisco activase removes XuBP from the active site of Rubisco in an ATP-dependent process(5,6). However, free XuBP rapidly rebinds to Rubisco, perpetuating its inhibitory effect. Here, we combine biochemical and structural analyses to show that the CbbY protein of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Arabidopsis thaliana is a highly selective XuBP phosphatase. We also show that CbbY converts XuBP to the non-inhibitory compound xylulose-5-phosphate, which is recycled back to RuBP. We solve the crystal structures of CbbY from R. sphaeroides and A. thaliana, and through mutational analysis show that the cap domain of the protein confers the selectivity for XuBP over RuBP. Finally, in vitro experiments with CbbY from R. sphaeroides reveal that CbbY cooperates with Rubisco activase to prevent a detrimental build-up of XuBP at the Rubisco active site. We suggest that CbbY, which is conserved in algae and plants, is an important component of the cellular machinery that has evolved to deal with the shortcomings of the ancient enzyme Rubisco.","[Bracher, Andreas; Sharma, Anurag; Starling-Windhof, Amanda; Hartl, F.

Specificity factors of purified Rubisco from 24 species of C-3 plants found in diverse habitats with a wide range of environmental growth limitations by both water availability and temperature in the Balearic Islands were measured at 25 degrees C. The results suggest that specificity factors are more dependent on environmental pressure than on phylogenetic factors. Irrespective of phylogenetic relationships, higher specificity factors were found in species characteristically growing in dryer environments and in species that are hemideciduous or evergreen. Effects of temperature on specificity factor of the purified enzyme from 14 species were consistent with the concept that higher specificity factors were associated with an increase in the activation energy for oxygenation compared to carboxylation of the 2,3-enediolate of RuBP to the respective transition state intermediates.

Photosynthesis during sunflecks is an important component of carbon gain. Field measurements demonstrated that Shorea leprosula seedlings in a rain forest understorey received a high proportion of daily photon flux density at temperatures supra-optimal for photosynthesis ( 72% at greater than or equal to30degreesC, 14% at greater than or equal to35degreesC). To investigate the effect of high temperatures on photosynthesis during sunflecks, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were made on seedlings grown in controlled environment conditions either, under uniform, saturating irradiance (approximately 539 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) or, shade/fleck sequences (approximately 30 mumol m(-2) s(-)1/approximately 525 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) at two temperatures, 28 or 38degreesC. The rate of light-saturated photosynthesis, under uniform irradiance, was inhibited by 40% at 38degreesC compared with 28degreesC. However, during the shade/fleck sequence, photosynthesis was inhibited by 59% at 38degreesC compared with 28degreesC. The greater inhibition of photosynthesis during the shade/fleck sequence, when compared with uniform irradiance, was driven by the lower efficiency of dynamic photosynthesis combined with lower steady-state rates of photosynthesis. These results suggest that, contrary to current dogma, sunfleck activity may not always result in significant carbon gain. This has important consequences for seedling regeneration processes in tropical forests as well as for leaves in other canopy positions where sunflecks make an important contribution to total photon flux density.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",,"Scholes, JD (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Alfred Denny Bldg,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",England,Europe,Global North,J.Scholes@Sheffield.ac.uk,"Leakey, Andrew/Q-9889-2016; Press, Malcolm Colin/ABB-3995-2021","Leakey, Andrew/0000-0001-6251-024X; Scholes, Julie/0000-0002-8540-5319",,,68,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,OCT,2003,26,10,10.1046/j.1365-3040.2003.01086.x,Plant Sciences,725GT,WOS:000185536000008,,"Green Published, Bronze",Bronze

We distinguished between the age-dependent changes in net assimilation rates due to modifications in leaf dry mass per unit area (M-A), foliar nitrogen content per unit dry mass (N-M), and fractional partitioning of foliar nitrogen in the proteins of photosynthetic electron transport (F-B), Rubisco (F-R) and in light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes (V-cmax;A proportional to MANMFR; J(max;A) proportional to MANMFB). In both species, increases in J(max;A) and V-cmax;A during leaf development were primarily determined by nitrogen allocation to growing leaves, increases in leaf nitrogen partitioning in photosynthetic machinery, and increases in M-A. Canopy differences in the rate of development of leaf photosynthetic capacity were mainly controlled by the rate of change in M-A. There was only small within-canopy variation in the initial rate of biomass accumulation per unit Q(int) (slope of M-A versus leaf age relationship per unit Q(int)), suggesting that canopy differences in the rate of development of J(max;A) and V-cmax;A are directly proportional to Q(int). Nevertheless, M-A, nitrogen, J(max;A) and V-cmax;A of mature leaves were not proportional to Q(int) because of a finite M-A in leaves immediately after bud-burst (light-independent component of M-A). M-A, leaf chlorophyll contents and chlorophyll : N ratio of mature leaves were best correlated with the integrated average quantum flux density during leaf development, suggesting that foliar photosynthetic apparatus, once developed, is not affected by day-to-day fluctuations in Q(int). However, for the upper canopy leaves of P. tremula and for the entire canopy of T. cordata, there was a continuous decline in N contents per unit dry mass in mature non-senescent leaves on the order of 15-20% for a change of leaf age from 40 to 120 d, possibly manifesting nitrogen reallocation to bud formation. The decline in N contents led to similar decreases in leaf photosynthetic capacity and foliar chlorophyll contents. These data demonstrate that light-dependent variation in the rate of developmental changes in M-A determines canopy differences in photosynthetic capacity, whereas foliar photosynthetic apparatus is essentially constant in fully developed leaves.","Univ Tartu, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Dept Plant Physiol, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; Ctr Ecol Alpina, I-38040 Viote Del Monte Bondone, TN, Italy; Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, Dept Appl Ecol, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; Univ Bayreuth, LS Pflanzenokol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",,"Niinemets, U (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Dept Plant Physiol, Riia 23, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia.",Estonia,Europe,Global North,ylo@zbi.ee,"Niinemets, Ulo/A-3816-2008","Niinemets, Ulo/0000-0002-3078-2192",,,81,139,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,MAR,2004,27,3,10.1111/j.1365-3040.2003.01143.x,Plant Sciences,775PQ,WOS:000189050800003,,Bronze,Bronze

Capillary electrophoresis is potentially a more simple and cost-effective method (with respect to time and consumables) but needs substantial development, especially for native plants which are frequently poor in protein and rich in interfering substances (oils, tannins, phenols). We report here the development of capillary electrophoresis (CE) for the separation of SDS-protein complexes (by molecular mass) and their quantification in plant tissues, In Leaf extracts, two peaks dominated the electropherograms, these peaks had migration times corresponding to the small and large subunits of Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; EC 4.1.1.39) and co-migrated with added purified Rubisco. Linearity of peak area, reproducibility of migration time and peak areas for the small and large subunit were excellent, suggesting Rubisco could be quantified with a high degree of accuracy. We determined how the concentration (0.5 or 4 mM) and form of N applied (nitrate versus ammonium) affects partitioning of N to Rubisco in seedlings of Eucalyptus diversicolor. Analysis of extracts from leaves of E. diversicolor was only possible after precipitation of proteins with trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Precipitation with TCA was highly reproducible and recovery of added Rubisco through procedures of extraction, precipitation and analysis were close to 100% for both subunits. An 8-fold difference in the concentration of N applied did not affect total N, the concentration of Rubisco or the fraction of N present as Rubisco. The similarity of total N may well reflect faster rates of growth in those plants receiving 4 mM N, and a subsequent 'dilution' of tissue N. The N source did not affect total N, the concentration of Rubisco or the fraction of N present as Rubisco. Despite similar Rubisco concentrations, the total concentration of soluble proteins was greater in ammonium-grown plants.","Univ Western Australia, Dept Bot, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia",,"Warren, CR (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Dept Bot, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia.",Australia,Oceania,Global North,cwarren@cyllene.uwa.edu.au,"Chen, Zuliang/AAX-8090-2020; adams, mark a/H-1303-2012; Adams, Mark/H-1303-2012; Warren, Charles/A-6013-2011","adams, mark a/0000-0002-8154-0097; Chen, Zuliang/0000-0002-7999-660X; Adams, Mark/0000-0001-8989-508X; Warren, Charles/0000-0002-0788-4713",,,41,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-9317,1399-3054,SEP,2000,110,1,10.1034/j.1399-3054.2000.110107.x,Plant Sciences,354VE,WOS:000089349700007,,,

In this study, we present the profile of Rubisco kinetics for 20 crop species at three different temperatures. The results largely confirmed the existence of significant variation in the Rubisco kinetics among species. Although some of the species tended to present Rubisco with higher thermal sensitivity (e.g. Oryza sativa) than others (e.g. Lactuca sativa), interspecific differences depended on the kinetic parameter. Comparing the temperature response of the different kinetic parameters, the Rubisco K-m for CO2 presented higher energy of activation than the maximum carboxylation rate and the CO2 compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration. The analysis of the Rubisco large subunit sequence revealed the existence of some sites under adaptive evolution in branches with specific kinetic traits. Because Rubisco kinetics and their temperature dependency were species specific, they largely affected the assimilation potential of Rubisco from the different crops, especially under those conditions (i.e. low CO2 availability at the site of carboxylation and high temperature) inducing Rubisco-limited photosynthesis. As an example, at 25 degrees C, Rubisco from Hordeum vulgare and Glycine max presented, respectively, the highest and lowest potential for CO2 assimilation at both high and low chloroplastic CO2 concentrations. In our opinion, this information is relevant to improve photosynthesis models and should be considered in future attempts to design more efficient Rubiscos.","[Hermida-Carrera, Carmen; Galmes, Jeroni] Univ Illes Balears, Res Grp Plant Biol Mediterranean Condit, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Balearic Island, Spain; [Kapralov, Maxim V.] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England",,"Galmes, J (corresponding author), Univ Illes Balears, Res Grp Plant Biol Mediterranean Condit, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Balearic Island, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,jeroni.galmes@uib.cat,"Hermida-Carrera, Carmen/AAN-5926-2020; Galmés, Jeroni/J-6749-2017","Galmés, Jeroni/0000-0002-7299-9349; Kapralov, Maxim/0000-0001-7966-0295; Hermida-Carrera, Carmen/0000-0003-3272-3054","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [AGL2009-07999, AGL2013-42364R]; Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government [BES-2010-030796]",This study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (project nos.

Despite these efforts, biotic and abiotic stresses continue to impact rice production. Rice blast disease, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is the most devastating disease affecting rice worldwide. In the field, resistant varieties are unstable and can become susceptible to disease within a few years of release due to the adaptive potential of the blast fungus, specifically in the effector (avirulence [AVR]) gene pool. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of the effector gene AVR-Pik in 58 rice blast isolates from Thailand and examined the interaction between AVR-Pik and the cognate rice resistance gene Pik. Our results reveal that Thai rice blast isolates are very diverse. We observe four AVR-Pik variants in the population, including three previously identified variants, AVR-PikA, AVR-PikD, and AVR-PikE, and one novel variant, which we named AVR-PikF. Interestingly, 28 of the isolates contained two copies of AVR-Pik, always in the combination of AVR-PikD and AVR-PikF. Blast isolates expressing only AVR-PikF show high virulence to rice cultivars encoding allelic Pik resistance genes, and the AVR-PikF protein does not interact with the integrated heavy metal-associated domain of the Pik resistance protein in vitro, suggesting a mechanism for immune evasion.","[Longya, Apinya; Chaipanya, Chaivarakun; Jantasuriyarat, Chatchawan] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Genet, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Longya, Apinya; Franceschetti, Marina; Maidment, Josephine H.

Data from MIT cell viability assays indicated that AEA induced both time- and dose-dependant cytotoxicity with an IC50 value of 14.0 mu M within 36 h of treatment on MCF-7 cells, but not in HMEC normal control cells. Both annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometric analysis and DNA fragmentation assays confirmed that AEA induced cell death via apoptosis. AEA was also found to induce cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells at the G(0)/G(1) phase with no adverse cell cycle arrest effects on HMEC normal control cells.

We have used electrophytografic technique (EPG) with sub-dermal electrodes inserted in 15-days-old seedlings located between root and shoot, accounting for a significant part of the individual seedlings. Herein, to work on a specific framework to settle this type of the study, we are adopting the term electrome as a reference to the totality of electrical activity measured. Taking into account the non-linear dynamic of the plants electrophysiology, we have hypothesized that the stimuli, as applied in a constant way, could push the system to a critical state, exhibiting spikes without a characteristic size, indicating self-organized criticality (SOC). The results from the power spectral density analysis (PSD), showed that the interval of the large majority of the beta exponents were between 1.5 and 3, indicating that the time series, regardless environmental conditions, showed long-range temporal correlation (long memory for beta not equal 0 and beta not equal 2). The analyses from the histograms of the runs showed different patterns of distributions concerning the experimental conditions. However, the runs exhibiting typical spikes, mostly under low light and osmotic stress, showed power law distribution with exponent mu congruent to 2, which is an indicative for SOC. Overall, our results have confirmed that the temporal dynamic of the electrical signaling shows a complex non-linear behavior with long-range persistence. Moreover, the hypothesis that plant electrome can exhibit a self-organized critical state evoked by environmental cues, dissipating energy by bursts of electrical spikes without a characteristic size, was reinforced. Finally, new perspectives for research and additional hypothesis were presented.","[Souza, Gustavo M.; Toledo, Gabriel R.

Using 1.5 Mb of genomic sequences from short arms of chromosome 3 of Oryza glaberrima and O. punctata, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis with the reference O. sativa ssp. japonica genome. We identified a 60-kb segment located in the middle of the subtelomeric region of chromosome 3, which is unique to the species O. sativa. The region contained gene duplicates that occurred in Asian cultivated rice species that diverged from the ancestor of Asian and African cultivated rice one million years ago (MYA). For the 12 genes and one complete retrotransposon identified in this segment in O. sativa ssp. japonica, we searched for their parental genes. The high similarity between duplicated paralogs further supports the recent origination of these genes. We found that this segment was recently generated through multiple independent gene recombination and transposon insertion events. Among the 12 genes, we found that five had chimeric gene structures derived from multiple parental genes. Nine out of the 12 new genes seem to be functional, as suggested by Ka/Ks analysis and the presence of cDNA and/or MPSS data. Furthermore, for the eight transcribed genes, at least two genes could be classified as defense or stress response-related genes. Given these findings, and the fact that subtelomeres are associated with high rates of recombination and transcription, it is likely that subtelomeres may facilitate gene recombination and transposon insertions and serve as hot spots for new gene origination in rice genomes.","[Zhang, Yong; Long, Manyuan] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rounsley, Steve] Univ Arizona, Inst Collaborat Res BIO5, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Fan, Chuanzhu; Yu, Yeisoo; Wing, Rod A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Plant Sci, Arizona Genom Inst, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Long, M (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 940 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,mlong@uchicago.edu; rwing@ag.arizona.edu,"Zhang, Yong E./AAC-8610-2019; Zhang, Yong/A-7855-2011; Wing, Rod A/Z-2885-2019","Zhang, Yong E./0000-0003-3770-2383; Wing, Rod A/0000-0001-6633-6226; Yu, Yeisoo/0000-0002-8410-0310","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-0321678]; Bud Antle Endowed Chair; National Science Foundation CAREER awardNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB0238168]; National Institute of Health R01United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM065429-01A1, 1R01GM078070-01A1]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM065429, R01GM078070] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant DBI-0321678 (to R.

Rice prolamins, alcohol-soluble seed storage proteins, accumulate directly within the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, leading to the formation of ER-derived type I protein bodies (PB-Is) in rice seed. Because rice prolamins do not possess a well-known ER retention signal such as K(H)DEL, or a unique sequence for retention in the ER such as a tandem repeat domain of maize and wheat prolamins, the mechanisms of prolamin accumulation in the ER and PB-I formation are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the formation mechanisms of PBs by expressing four types of rice prolamin species fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in transgenic rice calli. Each prolamin-GFP fusion protein was stably accumulated in rice calli and formed ER-derived PBs. In contrast, GFP fused with the signal peptide of prolamin was secreted into the intercellular space in rice calli. In addition, each of the four types of prolamin-GFP fusion proteins was co-localized with the ER chaperone binding protein. These results suggest that the mature polypeptide of prolamin is capable of being retained in the ER and induce the formation of PBs in non-seed tissue, and that the rice callus heterologous transgene expression system is useful for studying the mechanisms of rice PB-I formation.","[Shigemitsu, Takanari; Masumura, Takehiro; Morita, Shigeto; Satoh, Shigeru] Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Genet Engn Lab, Shimogamo, Kyoto 6068522, Japan; [Masumura, Takehiro; Morita, Shigeto; Satoh, Shigeru] Kyoto Prefectural Agr Forestry & Fisheries Techno, Dept Biotechnol Res, Seika, Kyoto 6190244, Japan",,"Masumura, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Genet Engn Lab, Shimogamo, Kyoto 6068522, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,masumura@kpu.ac.jp,"Morita, Shigeto/AAA-2500-2020","Morita, Shigeto/0000-0001-9796-9739","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [21580417]; Research and Development Projects for Application in Promoting New Policy of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries","This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) to T.M.

The DNA methylation levels found were consistent with those reported for other Angiosperms using the same HPLC technology. Notwithstanding noticeable time-related fluctuations within each source of plant material, methylation rate was overall higher for the mature clone (13.7%) than for the rejuvenated line of the same clone (12.6%) and for the juvenile offspring seedlings (11.8%). The in vitro microshoots of the mature clone were less methylated (11.3%) than the other outdoor origins, but the difference with the juvenile seedlings was not significant. Immunofluorescence investigations on shoot apices established that the mature source could be distinguished from the rejuvenated and juvenile origins by a higher density of cells with methylated nuclei in leaf primordia. Shoot apical meristems (SAMs) from the mature clone also showed a greater proportion and more methylated cells than SAMs from the rejuvenated and juvenile origins. The nuclei of these latter were characterized by fewer and more dispersed labeled spots than for the mature source. Our findings establish that physiological ageing induced quantitative and qualitative variations of DNA methylation at shoot tip, SAM and even cellular levels. Overall this DNA methylation increased with maturation and conversely decreased with rejuvenation to reach the lower scores and to show the immunolabeling patterns that characterized juvenile material nuclei.","[Monteuuis, Olivier] CIRAD BIOS, UMR DAP 1098, TA A96-03 Ave Agropolis, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Mankessi, Francois; Saya, Aubin R.] CRDPI, UR Genet Ameliorat Diversite, Pointe Noire, Rep Congo; [Favreau, Benedicte] CIRAD BIOS, UPR 39, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Doulbeau, Sylvie] IRD, UMR DIAPC, F-34394 Montpellier 5, France; [Conejero, Genevieve] INRA, UMR BPMP 5004, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Lartaud, Marc; Verdeil, Jean-Luc] CIRAD BIOS, UMR DAP, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",,"Monteuuis, O (corresponding author), CIRAD BIOS, UMR DAP 1098, TA A96-03 Ave Agropolis, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",France,Europe,Global North,olivier.monteuuis@cirad.fr,"Benedicte, Favreau/A-4604-2010","Benedicte, Favreau/0000-0003-2786-9374",International Foundation for ScienceInternational Foundation for Science; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; ATP CIRAD 'Meristemes'; CIRAD DESI,"The authors are indebted to the International Foundation for Science, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ATP CIRAD 'Meristemes' and CIRAD DESI for financial support to this study.

Also, to determine the antihyperglycemic action on normoglycemic rats by oral glucose tolerance test. Daily-administered morolic (1) and moronic (2) acids (50 mg/kg) significantly lowered the blood glucose levels at 60% since first day until tenth day after treatment than untreated group (p < 0.05). Moreover, analyzed blood samples obtained from diabetic rats indicated that both compounds diminished plasmatic concentration of cholesterol (CHO) and triglycerides (TG), returning them to normal levels (p < 0.05). Also, pretreatment with 50 mg/kg of each compound induced significant antihyperglycemic effect after glucose and sucrose loading (2 g/kg) compared with control group (p < 0.05). In vitro studies showed that compounds 1 and 2 induced inhibition of 11 beta-HSD 1 activity at 10 mu M. However, in silico analysis of the pentaclyclic triterpenic acids on 11 beta-HSD 1 revealed that all compounds had high docking scores and important interactions with the catalytic site allowing them to inhibit 11 beta-HSD 1 enzyme. In conclusion, morolic and moronic acids have shown sustained antidiabetic and antihyperglycemic action possibly mediated by an insulin sensitization with consequent changes of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides, in part mediated by inhibition of 11 beta-HSD 1 as indicated by in vitro and in silica studies.

Genes encoding Sop1 and Sop2, named caleosin and steroleosin for their calcium and sterol-binding capacity, respectively, have been cloned recently. Blast sequence analysis of the first 32 N-terminal residues revealed that Sop3 was presumably a steroleosin-like protein homologous to Sop2. A putative cDNA clone of Sop3 was obtained by PCR, and Subsequently confirmed by immunological recognition with antibodies against its over-expressed protein in Escherichia coli. Although Sop2 and Sop3, tentatively named steroleosin-A and -B, were found homologous, they could not be cross-recognized immunologically. Sequence comparison showed that these two steroleosins possessed a conserved NADP(+) binding subdomain but a diverse sterol-binding subdomain of different size. Both steroleosins were progressively accumulated in maturing seeds but with different cumulating patterns. Dehydrogenase activity detected in their expressed proteins indicated that steroleosin-B might comparably possess a broader sterol selectivity and higher NADP(+) specificity than steroleosin-A. Immunological cross-recognition implies that steroleosin-B is present in seed oil bodies of diverse species. A structural model of an oil-body was drawn with all its known essential constituents, and secondary structure organizations of the three classes of oil-body proteins were compared.

In order to investigate the functional role of this processing and its effect on folding assembly, wild-type GluA2 and its mutant cDNA (mGluA2), in which the conserved processing site (Asn-Gly) at the junction between the acidic and basic chains was replaced with Ala-Ala, were expressed under the control of the endosperm-specific GluB1 promoter in the mutant rice a123 line lacking glutelin GluA1, GluA2, and GluB4. The mGluA2 precursor was synthesized and stably targeted to PB-II without processing in the transgenic rice seeds like the wild-type GluA2. Notably, the saline-soluble mGluA2 precursor assembled with the other type of processed glutelin GluB as a trimer in PB-II, although such hetero-assembly with GluB was not detected in the transformant containing the processed GluA. Furthermore, the mGluA2 precursor in the glutelin fraction was deposited in PB-II by forming a quite different complex from the processed mature GluA2 products. These results indicate that post-translational processing of glutelin is not necessary for trafficking and stable accumulation in PB-II, but is required for the formation of the higher-order structure required for stacking in PB-II.","[Wakasa, Yuhya; Yang, Lijun; Hirose, Sakiko; Takaiwa, Fumio] Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Transgen Crop Res & Dev Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan",,"Takaiwa, F (corresponding author), Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Transgen Crop Res & Dev Ctr, Kannondai 3-1-3, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,takaiwa@nias.affrc.go.jp,,,"Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of JapanMinistry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan [GMC0008]; JSPS fellowsMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank Dr S Utsumi (Kyoto University) for gift of anti-GluA antibody and Ms Y Suzuki for technical assistance.

Analysis of 7134 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from cDNA libraries of P. triticina detected 204 EST-SSRs with a minimum of 12 repeating nucleotides. The majority of EST-SSRs contained short di- or tri-nucleotide repeats. These EST-SSRs were evaluated on 35 P. triticina isolates collected in Canada and 21 EST-SSRs were polymorphic and informative in determining intraspecific genetic diversity. A comparison of virulence and EST-SSR genotypes showed a strong correlation between virulence to Lr2a, Lr2c and Lr17a and EST-SSRs genotypes. The differentiation of the P. triticina population based on EST-SSR genotypes was comparable to that obtained with genomic SSRs, despite differences between two types of SSR markers. Eight of the 21 EST-SSRs produced the cross amplification in Puccinia coronata and Puccinia graminis, suggesting that EST-SSRs are more applicable than genomic SSRs for interspecific analysis. In summary, our study suggests that the data mining of EST databases is a feasible way to generate informative molecular markers for genetic studies of P. triticina.","[Wang, Xiben; Mulock, Barbara; Guus, Bakkeren] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Cereal Res Ctr, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N9, Canada; [McCallum, Brent] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agri Food Res Ctr, Summerland, BC V0H 1Z0, Canada",,"Wang, XB (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, Cereal Res Ctr, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N9, Canada.",Canada,North America,Global North,WangXib@agr.gc.ca,,,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 'Canadian Crop Genomics Initiative'Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),The work described in this study was supported by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 'Canadian Crop Genomics Initiative' fund.

A lipidomic analysis revealed that during natural and artificial aging of Arabidopsis seeds, levels of several diacylglycerols and free fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and linolenic acid as well as free oxidized fatty acids and oxygenated triacylglycerols, increased. Lipids can be oxidized by enzymatic or non-enzymatic processes. In the enzymatic pathway, lipoxygenases (LOXs) catalyze the first oxygenation step of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Analysis of lipid levels in mutants with defects in the two 9-LOX genes revealed that the strong increase in free 9-hydroxy-and 9-keto-fatty acids is dependent on LOX1 but not LOX5. Fatty acid oxidation correlated with an aging-induced decrease of germination, raising the question of whether these oxylipins negatively regulate germination. However, seeds of the lox1 mutant were only slightly more tolerant to aging, indicating that 9-LOX products contribute to but are not the major cause of loss of germination during aging. In contrast to free oxidized fatty acids, accumulation of oxygenated triacylglycerols upon accelerated aging was mainly based on non-enzymatic oxidation of seed storage lipids.","[Oenel, Ayla; Fekete, Agnes; Krischke, Markus; Faul, Sophie C.; Gresser, Gabriele; Mueller, Martin J.; Berger, Susanne] Univ Wurzburg, Julius von Sachs Inst, Pharmaceut Biol, Julius von Sachs Pl 2, D-97082 Wurzburg, Germany; [Havaux, Michel] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS UMR7265, CEA, Lab Ecophysiol Mol Plantes, F-13108 St Paul Les Durance, France",,"Berger, S (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Julius von Sachs Inst, Pharmaceut Biol, Julius von Sachs Pl 2, D-97082 Wurzburg, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,berger@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,"mueller, martin j/C-7616-2019; Fekete, Agnes/C-8048-2019","Fekete, Agnes/0000-0003-3058-7570",German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [GK 1342],"This work was supported by the German Research Foundation [GK 1342 to A.O., S.B. and M.M.].",43,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,1471-9053,MAY,2017,58,5,10.1093/pcp/pcx036,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,EW9QD,WOS:000402853400007,28371855,Bronze,

Despite substantial economic losses caused by these diseases, the defence mechanisms against this pathogen remain poorly understood. Several hormones are suggested to aid in defence against C. graminicola, such as jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), but supporting genetic evidence was not reported. Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are a group of well-characterized volatiles that induce JA biosynthesis in maize and are known to function in defence against necrotrophic pathogens. Information regarding the role of GLVs and JA in interactions with (hemi)biotrophic pathogens remains limited. To functionally elucidate GLVs and JA in defence against a hemibiotrophic pathogen, we tested GLV- and JA-deficient mutants, lox10 and opr7 opr8, respectively, for resistance to ASR and ALB and profiled jasmonates and SA in their stalks and leaves throughout infection. Both mutants were resistant and generally displayed elevated levels of SA and low amounts of jasmonates, especially at early stages of infection. Pretreatment with GLVs restored susceptibility of lox10 mutants, but not opr7 opr8 mutants, which coincided with complete rescue of JA levels. Exogenous methyl jasmonate restored susceptibility in both mutants when applied before inoculation, whereas methyl salicylate did not induce further resistance in either of the mutants, but did induce mutant-like resistance in the wild type. Collectively, this study reveals that GLVs and JA contribute to maize susceptibility to C. graminicola due to suppression of SA-related defences.","[Gorman, Zachary; Christensen, Shawn A.; Yan, Yuanxin; He, Yongming; Borrego, Eli; Kolomiets, Michael, V] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Christensen, Shawn A.] USDA ARS, Chem Res Unit, Ctr Med Agr & Vet Entomol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Yan, Yuanxin] Nanjing Agr Univ, State Key Lab Crop Genet & Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [He, Yongming] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Jiangxi Key Lab Crop Physiol Ecol & Genet Breedin, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Borrego, Eli] Rochester Inst Technol, Thomas H Gosnell Sch Life Sci, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",,"Kolomiets, MV (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,kolomiets@tamu.edu,"Borrego, Eli/G-9867-2011","Borrego, Eli/0000-0002-3538-3203; Kolomiets, Michael/0000-0003-1038-9534",USDA-NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2017-6701326524],The work performed in this study was supported by USDA-NIFA (2017-6701326524) grant awarded to M.V.

Using 3 Arabidopsis ecotypes in conjunction with various transgenic and mutant lines, we provide evidence that wounding and drought differentially alter the metabolic signatures derived from the 2 main competing oxylipin-pathway branches, namely the JA and its precursor 12-OPDA produced by Allene oxide synthase (AOS) branch, and aldehydes and corresponding alcohols generated by Hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) branch. Specifically, we show that wounding induces production of both HPL and AOS-derived metabo-lites whereas, drought stress only elicits production of hexenal but suppresses hexenol, and further uncouples the conversion of 12-OPDA to JA. This finding led to uncovering of 12-OPDA as a functional convergence point of oxylipin and ABA pathways to control stomatal aperture in plant adaptive responses to drought. In addition, using transgenic lines overexpressing plastidial and extraplastidial HPL enzyme establish the strong interdependence of AOS-and HPL-branch pathways, and the importance of this linkage in tailoring plant adaptive responses to the nature of perturbations.","[Savchenko, Tatyana; Dehesh, Katayoon] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Dehesh, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,kdehesh@ucdavis.edu,"Savchenko, Tatyana/E-7091-2014","Savchenko, Tatyana/0000-0003-0126-4932",National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM107311]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS1036491]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM107311] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This work was supported by National Institute of Health (R01GM107311) and National Science Foundation (IOS1036491) grants awarded to KD.,,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1559-2316,1559-2324,,2014,9,4,10.4161/psb.28304,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,24614570,"Green Published, Bronze",

Examination of the enzymatic activity of recombinant GST-OsAOC indicated that OsAOC is a functional enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and related compounds. The level of jasmonate was extremely low in both mutants, in agreement with the fact that rice has only one gene encoding allene oxide cyclase. Several flower-related mutant phenotypes were observed, including morphological abnormalities of the flower and early flowering. We used these mutants to investigate the function of jasmonate in the defence response to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Inoculation assays with fungal spores revealed that both mutants are more susceptible than wild-type to an incompatible strain of M. oryzae, in such a way that hyphal growth was enhanced in mutant tissues. The level of jasmonate isoleucine, a bioactive form of jasmonate, increased in response to blast infection. Furthermore, blast-induced accumulation of phytoalexins, especially that of the flavonoid sakuranetin, was found to be severely impaired in cpm2 and hebiba. Together, the present study demonstrates that, in rice, jasmonate mediates the defence response against blast fungus.","[Riemann, Michael; Nick, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Bot, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Riemann, Michael; Ando, Sugihiro; Mochizuki, Susumu; Nishizawa, Yoko; Minami, Eiichi; Takano, Makoto] Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Div Plant Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan; [Haga, Ken; Iino, Moritoshi] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Bot Gardens, Katano, Osaka 5760004, Japan; [Shimizu, Takafumi; Okada, Kazunori; Yamane, Hisakazu] Univ Tokyo, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Yamanouchi, Utako] Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Rice Appl Genom Res Unit, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan; [Yano, Masahiro] Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Agrigenom Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058634, Japan; [Yamane, Hisakazu] Teikyo Univ, Dept Biosci, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3208551, Japan",,"Iino, M (corresponding author), Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Bot Gardens, Katano, Osaka 5760004, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,iino@sci.osaka-cu.ac.jp,"Shimizu, Takafumi/C-4123-2017; Yano, Masahiro/AAC-5441-2019; Ando, Sugihiro/T-5720-2019","Shimizu, Takafumi/0000-0003-4372-1337; Mochizuki, Susumu/0000-0003-0200-4366; Riemann, Michael/0000-0003-0287-2112","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16370027]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (KAKENHI)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23120524]; Programme for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24657037, 24657027] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI grant number 16370027) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (KAKENHI grant number 23120524) to M.I., and by the Programme for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry to K.O. and H.Y.

In order to provide a convincing answer, we analyzed the early transcriptional profile of Arabidopsis cells at high light (HL). The results showed that ACSC respond to HL in a manner that resembles the singlet oxygen (O-1(2))-mediated defense responses described for the conditional fluorescent (flu) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana. The flu mutant is characterized by the accumulation of free protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) in plastids when put into darkness and the subsequent production of O-1(2) when the light is on. In ACSC, O-1(2) is produced in chloroplasts at HL when excess excitation energy flows into photosystem II (PSII). Other reactive oxygen species are also produced in ACSC at HL, but to a lesser extent. When the HL stress ceases, ACSC recovers the initial rate of oxygen evolution and cell growth continues. We can conclude that chloroplasts of ACSC are both photosynthetically active and capable of initiating O-1(2) -mediated signaling cascades that activate a broad range of genetically-controlled defense responses. The upregulation of transcripts associated with the biosynthesis and signaling pathways of OPDA (12-oxophytodienoic acid) and ethylene (ET) suggests that the activated defense responses at HL are governed by these two hormones. In contrast to the flu mutant, the O-1(2) -mediated defense responses were independent of the upregulation of EDS1 (enhanced disease susceptibility) required for the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and genetically-controlled cell death. Interestingly, a high correlation in transcriptional expression was also observed between ACSC at HL, and the aba1 and max4 mutants of Arabidopsis, characterized by defects in the biosynthesis pathways of abscisic acid (ABA) and strigolactones, respectively.","[Gutierrez, Jorge; Gonzalez-Perez, Sergio; Arellano, Juan B.] Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol Salamanca IRNASA CSI, Salamanca, Spain; [Garcia-Garcia, Francisco] Ctr Invest Principe Felipe, Natl Inst Bioinformat, Funct Genom Node, Valencia, Spain; [Lorenzo, Oscar] Univ Salamanca, Fac Biol, Dept Fisiol Vegetal, Ctr Hispanoluso Invest Agr, Salamanca, Spain",,"Arellano, JB (corresponding author), Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol Salamanca IRNASA CSI, Salamanca, Spain.",Spain,Europe,Global North,juan.arellano@irnasa.csic.es,"García-García, Francisco/B-1929-2014; Pérez, Sergio González/M-2831-2014; García-García, Francisco/N-2263-2019; Lorenzo, Oscar/K-8170-2014; Arellano, Juan B./D-7174-2013","García-García, Francisco/0000-0001-8354-5636; Pérez, Sergio González/0000-0001-7558-4109; García-García, Francisco/0000-0001-8354-5636; Lorenzo, Oscar/0000-0001-9523-0789; Arellano, Juan B./0000-0001-8677-8697",Junta de Castilla y LeonJunta de Castilla y Leon [CSI002A10-2],This work was supported by Junta de Castilla y Leon (grant number CSI002A10-2).,,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1559-2316,1559-2324,,2011,6,12,10.4161/psb.6.12.18264,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,22112448,"Bronze, Green Submitted, Green Published",

Presumably, they are involved in the regulation of seed embryogenesis, dormancy, and germination. However, their spatial localization in the developing Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common bean) seeds has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) was performed to investigate their localization in the developing seeds. Peaks corresponding to the chemical formulae of alpha LA and 3-oxo-2-(2-(Z)-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0) were localized mainly in the radicle and seed coat, while that of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in the seed coat. This was consistent with the quantitative results obtained using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) analysis. In contrast, DESI-tandem MSI (MS/MSI) and LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that the effects of isomers on the DESI-MSI ion images were small for alpha LA and OPDA, but not for OPC-8:0. This indicated that DESI-MSI could accurately visualize alpha LA and OPDA, while DESI-MS/MSI was necessary to visualize OPC-8:0. The results demonstrated that free alpha LA and OPC-8:0 were abundant in the radicle and seed coat, while free OPDA was accumulated in the seed coat. Interestingly, the localization pattern of OPDA was similar to that of JA. In addition, compared to the concentrations of OPDA, the concentration of OPC-8:0 was lower in the seed coat and higher in the radicle. These results suggest that OPDA and/or JA play a biological role mainly in the seed coat, while OPC-8:0 is biologically active mainly in the radicle. Therefore, DESI-MSI coupled with LC-ESI-MS is a useful tool for spatial analysis of JA-related compounds in developing common bean seeds.","[Enomoto, Hirofumi; Miyamoto, Koji] Teikyo Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Biosci, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3208551, Japan; [Enomoto, Hirofumi; Miyamoto, Koji] Teikyo Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Div Integrated Sci & Engn, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3208551, Japan; [Enomoto, Hirofumi] Teikyo Univ, Adv Instrumental Anal Ctr, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3208551, Japan",,"Enomoto, H (corresponding author), Teikyo Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Biosci, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3208551, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,enomoto@nasu.bio.teikyo-u.ac.jp,,"Enomoto, Hirofumi/0000-0001-5515-6019",Advanced Comprehensive Research Grant of Teikyo University; ACRO Research Grants of Teikyo University,"We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Mitsunori Seo and Dr. Shunsuke Watanabe at the RIKEN for providing the OPC-8:0 standard, and Dr. Kenichi Uchida at the Teikyo University for his helpful comments on the standard.

Its asexual reproduction plays an important role in the rapid propagation and spread of the disease in the field. A global proteomics study was conducted to compare two key asexual life stages of P. capsici, i.e. the mycelium and cysts, to identify stage-specific biochemical processes. A total of 1200 proteins was identified using qualitative and quantitative proteomics. The transcript abundance of some of the enriched proteins was also analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Seventy-three proteins exhibited different levels of abundance between the mycelium and cysts. The proteins enriched in the mycelium are mainly associated with glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (or citric acid) cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway, providing the energy required for the biosynthesis of cellular building blocks and hyphal growth. In contrast, the proteins that are predominant in cysts are essentially involved in fatty acid degradation, suggesting that the early infection stage of the pathogen relies primarily on fatty acid degradation for energy production. The data provide a better understanding of P. capsici biology and suggest potential metabolic targets at the two different developmental stages for disease control.","[Pang, Zhili; Liu, Xili] China Agr Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Coll Agr & Biotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Pang, Zhili; Srivastava, Vaibhav; Bulone, Vincent] AlbaNova Univ Ctr, Royal Inst Technol KTH, Div Glycosci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bulone, Vincent] Univ Adelaide, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Plant Cell, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia",,"Liu, XL (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Coll Agr & Biotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.; Bulone, V (corresponding author), AlbaNova Univ Ctr, Royal Inst Technol KTH, Div Glycosci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.; Bulone, V (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Plant Cell, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia.",Australia,Oceania,Global North,seedling@cau.edu.cn; bulone@kth.se,"Bulone, Vincent/D-7469-2013; Bulone, Vincent/C-8492-2019; Srivastava, Vaibhav/H-1320-2015","Bulone, Vincent/0000-0003-2809-4160; Srivastava, Vaibhav/0000-0003-1877-4154; Pang, Zhili/0000-0001-8047-1272",National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31272061]; Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [201303023]; Swedish Science Council FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas [2009-515]; China Scholarship Council programmeChina Scholarship Council,"This work was partially funded by the National Science Foundation of China (31272061), the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (201303023) and the Swedish Science Council FORMAS (grant # 2009-515 to VB).

However, systematic and comprehensive analyses of OPR genes in watermelon and their roles in defence responses are extremely limited. The physicochemical properties, phylogenetic tree, gene structure and cis-acting elements of watermelon OPR genes were analysed using bioinformatics, and qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq were applied to assay expression of OPR genes in watermelon. A total of five OPR family genes were identified in watermelon, which were unevenly distributed across the four chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis assigned OPR members from different plant species to five subfamilies (OPRI-OPRV). The motif compositions of OPR members were relatively conserved. Expression analysis using qRT-PCR revealed that ClOPR genes, except for ClOPR5, were highly expressed in the flower and fruit. RNA-seq analysis showed that the ClOPR genes had different expression patterns during flesh and rind development. Furthermore, the ClOPR genes, particularly ClOPR2 and ClOPR4, were significantly upregulated by exogenous JA, salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) treatments. In addition, red light induced expression of ClOPR2 and ClOPR4 in leaves and roots of root-knot nematode (RKN)-infected watermelon plants, suggesting their involvement in red light-induced defence against RKN. These results provide a theoretical basis for elucidating the diverse functions of OPR family genes in watermelon.","[Guang, Y.; Luo, S.; Xiao, X.; Li, J.; Yang, Y.] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Jiangxi Key Lab Postharvest Technol & Nondestruct, Postharvest Key Technol & Qual Safety Fruits & Ve, Collaborat Innovat Ctr,Coll Agron, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Y.] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Bioengn, Jiangxi Engn Lab Dev & Utilizat Agr Microbial Res, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ahammed, G.

OPR3-like enzymes belong to subgroup II, and they were proved to be key functional enzymes participating in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, while functions of OPR1-like enzymes classified into subgroup I remain largely unclear, particularly in symbiosis. This study identified and functionally characterized a gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase in Astragalus sinicus. Sequence homology analysis indicated that this gene encodes an OPR1-like enzyme. It was found that the gene expression of AsOPR1 was upregulated after inoculation with Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R. Subcellular localization showed that in uninfected host plant cells, AsOPR1 was localized in the amyloplast, a differentiated form of plastid; while in the infected cells, AsOPR1 co-localized with rhizobia. Knockdown of the AsOPR1 gene decreased the nodule number to 34.6% that of the control roots, and significantly reduced the JA level in both transgenic roots and nodules, while overexpression of the AsOPR1 gene resulted in enlarged nodule meristem, but caused no changes in nodule number. Taken together, these results indicate that AsOPR1 may participate in the regulation of nodule formation and development, as well as affect endogenous JA metabolism.","[Wei, Feng; Lei, Lei; Chen, Fangfang; Wu, Mei; Chen, Dasong; Li, Youguo] Huazhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Li, YG (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,youguoli@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,"wei, feng/0000-0002-8002-2589","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0100702]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31371549, 31670243, 31460056]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016PY025]; State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology [AMLKF2014]","This work was supported by the funds from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant no. 2016YFD0100702), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 31371549, 31670243, and 31460056), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2016PY025), and the State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology (grant no.

It catalyzes the first step following cyclization in sterol biosynthesis, leading to the formation of precursors of steroid hormones, including brassinosteroids, in plants. Most enzymes involved in the plant sterol biosynthesis pathway have been characterized biochemically and the corresponding genes cloned. Genes coding for enzymes promoting substrate modifications before 24-methylenelophenol lead to embryonic and seed defects when mutated, while mutants downstream the 24-methylenelophenol intermediate show phenotypes characteristic of brassinosteroid mutants. By a differential display approach, we have isolated a fertilization-induced gene, encoding a sterol 14 alpha-demethylase enzyme, named CYP51G1-Sc. Functional characterization of CYP51G1-Sc expressed in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed that it could demethylate obtusifoliol, as well as nontypical plant sterol biosynthetic intermediates (lanosterol), in contrast with the strong substrate specificity of the previously characterized obtusifoliol 14 alpha-demethylases found in other plant species. CYP51G1-Sc transcripts are mostly expressed in meristems and in female reproductive tissues, where they are induced following pollination. Treatment of the plant itself with obtusifoliol induced the expression of the CYP51G1-Sc mRNA, suggesting a possible role of this transient biosynthetic intermediate as a bioactive signaling lipid molecule. Furthermore, treatments of leaves with C-14-labeled obtusifoliol demonstrated that this sterol could be transported in distal parts of the plant away from the sprayed leaves. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CYP51 homozygous knockout mutants were also lethal, suggesting important roles for this enzymatic step and its substrate in plant development.","Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; CNRS, Unite Propre Rech 2357, Inst Biol Mol Plantes, Dept Isoprenoides, F-67083 Strasbourg, France",,"Matton, DP (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.",Canada,North America,Global North,dp.matton@umontreal.ca,,,,,78,31,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,OCT,2005,139,2,10.1104/pp.105.066639,Plant Sciences,973CJ,WOS:000232500200017,16169959,"Bronze, Green Published",

To identify pathogenic compounds targeting plant H+-ATPases, we screened extracts from 10 Stemphylium species for their effect on H+-ATPase activity. We identified Stemphylium loti extracts as potential H+-ATPase inhibitors, and through chemical separation and analysis, tenuazonic acid (TeA) as a potent H+-ATPase inhibitor. By assaying ATP hydrolysis and H+ pumping, we confirmed TeA as a H+-ATPase inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. To visualize in planta inhibition of the H+-ATPase, we treated pH-sensing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with TeA and quantified apoplastic alkalization. TeA affected both ATPase hydrolysis and H+ pumping, supporting a direct effect on the H+-ATPase. We demonstrated apoplastic alkalization of A. thaliana seedlings after short-term TeA treatment, indicating that TeA effectively inhibits plant PM H+-ATPase in planta. TeA-induced inhibition was highly dependent on the regulatory C-terminal domain of the plant H+-ATPase. Stemphylium loti is a phytopathogenic fungus. Inhibiting the plant PM H+-ATPase results in membrane potential depolarization and eventually necrosis. The corresponding fungal H+-ATPase, PMA1, is less affected by TeA when comparing native preparations. Fungi are thus able to target an essential plant enzyme without causing self-toxicity.","[Bjork, Peter K.; Gjetting, Sisse K.; Havshoi, Nanna W.; Ipsen, Johan O.; Fuglsang, Anja T.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Rasmussen, Silas A.; Petersen, Thomas Isbrandt; Larsen, Thomas O.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Biotechnol & Biomed, Soltofts Plads B 221, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,"Fuglsang, AT (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",Denmark,Europe,Global North,atf@plen.ku.dk,"Fuglsang, Anja Thoe/A-6733-2015","Fuglsang, Anja Thoe/0000-0003-1153-8394; Gjetting, Sisse/0000-0002-7173-3880; Orskov Ipsen, Johan/0000-0001-5509-8496; Larsen, Thomas Ostenfeld/0000-0002-3362-5707; Havshoi, Nanna Weise/0000-0003-3486-271X","Danish Council for Independent Research, Technology and Production Sciences (FTP)Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [DFF-4184-00548 COMBAT]","We thank Lasse Kjellerup for kindly providing us with yeast microsomal fractions expressing PMA1.

In the flower, high expression was found in the pollen tube after in vitro or in vivo germination. Northern blotting analysis confirmed that NpPMA5 was expressed in the pollen tube contrary to NpPMA2 (subfamily I) or NpPMA4 (subfamily II), two genes highly expressed in other tissues. The subcellular localization of PM H+-ATPase in the pollen tube was analyzed by immunocytodecoration. As expected, this enzyme was localized to the plasma membrane. However, neither the tip nor the base of the pollen tube was labeled, showing an asymmetrical distribution of this enzyme. This observation supports the hypothesis that the PM H+-ATPase is involved in creating the pH gradient that is observed along the pollen tube and is implicated in cell elongation. Compared to other plant PM H+-ATPases, the C-terminal region of NpPMA5 is shorter by 26 amino acid residues and is modified in the last 6 residues, due to a sequence rearrangement, which was also found in the orthologous gene of Nicotiana glutinosa, a Nicotiana species distant from N. plumbaginifolia and Petunia hybrida and Lycopersicon esculentum, other Solanacae species.

As one of widely cultivated warm-season turfgrass, bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L).

In this study, proteomic analysis was performed to identify drought-responsive proteins in both leaves and stems of two bermudagrass varieties contrasting in drought stress resistance, including drought sensitive variety (Yukon) and drought tolerant variety (Tifgreen). Through comparative proteomic analysis, 39 proteins with significantly changed abundance were identified, including 3 commonly increased and 2 decreased proteins by drought stress in leaves and stems of Yukon and Tifgreen varieties, 2 differentially regulated proteins in leaves and stems of two varieties after drought treatment, 23 proteins increased by drought stress in Yukon variety and constitutively expressed in Tifgreen variety, and other 3 differentially expressed proteins under control and drought stress conditions. Among them, proteins involved in photosynthesis (PS), glycolysis, N-metabolism, tricarboxylicacid (TCA) and redox pathways were largely enriched, which might be contributed to the natural variation of drought resistance between Yukon and Tifgreen varieties. These studies provide new insights to understand the molecular mechanism underlying bermudagrass response to drought stress. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Both are cold-tolerant, and camelina is regarded to be especially appropriate for production on marginal lands. We examined physiological and biochemical alterations in both species during cold stress treatment for 3 days and subsequent recovery at the temperature of 25 degrees C for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 24 h, with particular emphasis on the post-translational regulation of the plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase (EC3.6.3.14). The activity and translation of the PM H+-ATPase, as well as 14-3-3 proteins, increased after 3 days of cold stress in both species but recovery under normal conditions proceeded differently. The increase in H+-ATPase activity was the most dramatic in camelina roots after recovery for 2 h at 25 degrees C, followed by decay to background levels within 24 h. In rapeseed, the change in H+-ATPase activity during the recovery period was less pronounced. Furthermore, H+-pumping increased in both species after 15 min recovery, but to twice the level in camelina roots compared to rapeseed. Protein gel blot analysis with phospho-threonine anti-bodies showed that an increase in phosphorylation levels paralleled the increase in H+-transport rate.

Assembly of the resulting EST sequences resulted in 2,878 putative unigenes. Blastn analysis showed that 62.6% of the unigenes matched with known cassava ESTs and the rest had no 'hits' against the cassava database in the integrative PlantGDB database.

Florigen is transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem and initiates floral evocation. In shoot apical cells, conserved cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins act as florigen receptors. A hexameric florigen activation complex (FAC) composed of Hd3a, 14-3-3 proteins, and OsFD1, a transcription factor, activates OsMADS15, a rice homolog of Arabidopsis APETALA1, leading to flowering. Because FD is a key component of the FAC, we characterized the FD gene family and their functions. Phylogenetic analysis of FD genes indicated that this family is divided into two groups: (i) canonical FD genes that are conserved among eudicots and non-Poaceae monocots; and (ii) Poaceae-specific FD genes that are organized into three subgroups: Poaceae FD1, FD2 and FD3. The Poaceae FD1 group shares a small sequence motif, T(A/V)LSLNS, with FDs of eudicots and non-Poaceae monocots. Overexpression of OsFD2, a member of the Poaceae FD2 group, produced smaller leaves with shorter plastochrons, suggesting that OsFD2 controls leaf development. In vivo subcellular localization of Hd3a, 14-3-3 and OsFD2 suggested that in contrast to OsFD1, OsFD2 is restricted to the cytoplasm through its interaction with the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins, and interaction of Hd3a with 14-3-3 facilitates nuclear translocation of the FAC containing OsFD2. These results suggest that FD function has diverged between OsFD1 and OsFD2, but formation of a FAC is essential for their function.","[Tsuji, Hiroyuki; Nakamura, Hiroyuki; Taoka, Ken-ichiro; Shimamoto, Ko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Plant Mol Genet Lab, Nara 6300192, Japan",,"Shimamoto, K (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Plant Mol Genet Lab, 8916-5 Takayama, Nara 6300192, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,simamoto@bs.naist.jp,,"Tsuji, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-6444-559X",Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry from Bio-oriented Research Advancement Institution (BRAIN),This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [to H.T and K.S.]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas [to K.S.]; the Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry from Bio-oriented Research Advancement Institution (BRAIN) [to H.T.].,58,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,1471-9053,MAR,2013,54,3,10.1093/pcp/pct005,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,106CK,WOS:000316118800010,23324168,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",

Gene expression is not affected when seedlings are supplied with glutamate (GLU), a precursor of GABA. The repression of 14-3-3 gene expression by GABA is dependent on functional ethylene and ABA signalling pathways, because the response is lost in the etr1-1, abi1-1 and abi2-1 mutants. Calcium measurements show that in contrast to GLU, GABA does not elicit a cytoplasmic calcium elevation, suggesting that the GABA response is unlikely to be mediated by GLU receptors (GLRs), as has been suggested previously. We suggest that in addition to its role as a stress-related metabolite, GABA may regulate gene expression in A. thaliana, including members of the 14-3-3 gene family.","Univ Lancaster, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England",,"Roberts, MR (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",England,Europe,Global North,m.r.roberts@lancaster.ac.uk,"Roberts, Michael R/H-2664-2012","Roberts, Michael R/0000-0002-1441-7363",,,41,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,JUL,2006,29,7,10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01526.x,Plant Sciences,050CF,WOS:000238064400022,17080964,"Green Accepted, Bronze",Bronze

Magnesium deficiency does not obligatorily lead to the decreased total protein concentrations in the leaves. Magnesium (Mg) is an integral component of the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS), having both a structural and a catalytic role. Moreover, Mg is relevant for the post-translational regulation of the GS. Glutamine synthetase is one of the key enzymes in nitrogen assimilation, ligating-free ammonium (NH4 (+)) to glutamate to form glutamine and it is therefore crucial for plant growth and productivity. This study was conducted in order to test whether a severe Mg-deficiency impairs the total capacity of the GS-catalyzed synthesis of glutamine in maize leaves. Maize was grown hydroponically and the GS activity was analyzed dependent on different leaf developmental stages. Glutamine synthetase activity in vitro assays in combination with immune-dot blot analysis revealed that both the total activity and the abundance of glutamine synthetase was not impaired in the leaves of maize plants upon 54 days of severe Mg starvation. Additionally, it was shown that Mg deficiency does not obligatorily lead to decreased total protein concentrations in the leaves, as assayed by Bradford protein quantification. Moreover, Mg resupply to the roots or the leaves of Mg-deficient plants reversed the Mg-deficiency-induced accumulation of free amino acids in older leaves, which indicates impaired phloem loading. The results of our study reveal that the total GS-mediated primary or secondary assimilation of free NH4 (+) is not a limiting enzymatic reaction under Mg deficiency and thus cannot be accountable for the observed restriction of plant growth and productivity in Mg-deficient maize.","[Jezek, Mareike; Geilfus, Christoph-Martin; Muehling, Karl-Hermann] Univ Kiel, Inst Plant Nutr & Soil Sci, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",,"Muhling, KH (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Plant Nutr & Soil Sci, Hermann Rodewald Str 2, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,khmuehling@plantnutrition.uni-kiel.de,"Muehling, Karl H./L-6443-2014","Muehling, Karl H./0000-0002-9922-6581; Jezek, Mareike/0000-0002-7460-0792",Heinrich-Boll-Foundation,Mareike Jezek receives a scholarship from the Heinrich-Boll-Foundation which is gratefully acknowledged.

Several different isozymes of SPS exist in plants. Genomic and EST sequence data from Arabidopsis, rice and maize has been analyzed. This analysis has revealed that the Arabidopsis genome contains four unique SPS genes. The rice databases (Monsanto proprietary, and public databases) contain five unique full-length SPS genes. Using the Monsanto maize EST and genomic sequence databases, we have identified five full length and two partial SPS sequences, bringing the total number of presently known maize SPS genes to at least seven. Phylogenetic analysis of all known SPS sequences revealed several putative evolutionary branches of SPS. We have classified SPS genes into three major groups in higher plants, all with distinct features from the known microbial SPS genes. Furthermore, this analysis suggests evolutionary divergence of monocotyledonous (monocot) and dicotyledonous (dicot) SPS sequences. The evidence suggests that several gene duplication events occurred at various points during evolution, both before and after the monocot/dicot split. It appears that at least one of the major forms of SPS genes may have evolved after the divergence of monocots and dicots. In addition, several more recent gene duplication events may have occurred after maize/rice speciation, giving rise to additional SPS genes in maize. Some of the variants tack one or more of the presently known regulatory sites, implying that this evolutionary divergence may have given rise to enzymes with functional differences. We present evidence from transcript distribution studies using cDNA libraries as well as transcriptional profiling experiments and propose that specific SPS genes have diverse patterns of expression that are sometimes responsive to environmental signals. Our data suggests that higher plant SPS isozymes differ with respect to their patterns of expression and regulation and that our proposed phylogenetic classification reflects specific functional categories for higher plant SPS isozymes.

NR activity in tomato roots increased significantly after 24 h of anaerobiosis and increased further by 48 h, with a concomitant release of nitrite into the culture medium. Anoxia promoted NR activation through dissociation of the 14-3-3 protein inhibitor and NR dephosphorylation. After 24 h of anoxia, the total amount of NR increased slightly up to 48 h. However, NR-mRNA levels remained constant between 0 h and 24 h of root anoxia and decreased after 48 h. This is probably due to the inhibition of NR degradation and the accumulation of its native form. NR was slightly dephosphorylated in the absence of oxygen and nitrate. Under anoxia, NR dephosphorylation was modulated by nitrate-controlled NR activity. In addition, the presence of nitrate prevents anoxic symptoms on leaves and delays wilting by 48 h during root anoxia. In the absence of nitrate, plants withered within 24 h, as they did with tungstate treatment, an inhibitor of NR activity. Thus, anoxia tolerance of tomato roots could be enhanced by nitrate reduction.","ENSAT, Lab Agron Environm Ecotoxicol, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France",,"Pinelli, E (corresponding author), ENSAT, Lab Agron Environm Ecotoxicol, Ave Agrobiopole Auzeville,Tolosane BP 107, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",France,Europe,Global North,pinelli@ensat.fr,"jerome, Silvestre/S-6870-2019",,,,66,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0022-0957,1460-2431,DEC,2004,55,408,10.1093/jxb/erh258,Plant Sciences,873BB,WOS:000225252600017,15475378,"Bronze, Green Submitted",Bronze

The divalent cation also affected the response of the enzyme from endosperm and shoots to adenine nucleotides and inorganic pyrophosphate. Gel filtration chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunostaining, and the use of a phosphopeptide containing a canonical binding motif showed that MgCl2 actually disrupted the interaction between GAPN and a 14-3-3 regulatory protein. After interaction with 14-3-3, phosphorylated GAPN exhibits a 3-fold lower V-max and higher sensitivity to inhibition by ATP and pyrophosphate. Results suggest that GAPN is a target for regulation by phosphorylation, levels of divalent cations, and 14-3-3 proteins. The regulatory mechanism could be critical to maintain levels of energy and reductants in the cytoplasm of heterotrophic plant cells.","Univ Nacl Litoral, Fac Bioquim & Ciencias Biol, Grp Enzimol Mol, Santa Fe, Argentina; Inst Tecnol Chascomus, Chascomus, Argentina",,"Iglesias, AA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Litoral, Fac Bioquim & Ciencias Biol, Grp Enzimol Mol, Paraje El Pozo CC 242, Santa Fe, Argentina.",Argentina,South America,Global South,iglesias@criba.edu.ar,,"Iglesias, Alberto/0000-0001-9729-7338",,,38,41,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,1532-2548,DEC,2003,133,4,10.1104/pp.103.030981,Plant Sciences,757BJ,WOS:000187528700065,14681537,"Bronze, Green Published",

Their presence as large gene families in plants underscores their essential role in plant physiology. We have examined the Arabidopsis thaliana 14-3-3 gene family, which currently is the largest and most complete 14-3-3 family with at least 12 expressed members and 15 genes from the now completed Arabidopsis thaliana genome project. The phylogenetic branching of this family serves as the prototypical model for comparison with other large plant 14-3-3 families and as such may serve to rationalize clustering in a biological context. Equally important for ascribing common functions for the various 14-3-3 isoforms is determining an isoform-specific correlation with localization and target partnering. A summary of localization information available in the literature is presented. In an effort to identify specific 14-3-3 isoform location and participation in cellular processes, we have produced a panel of isoform-specific antibodies to Arabidopsis thaliana 14-3-3s and present initial immunolocalization studies that suggest biologically relevant, discriminative partnering of 14-3-3 isoforms.","Univ Florida, Dept Hort Sci, Program Plant Cellular & Mol Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Lund Univ, Dept Plant Biochem, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",,"Ferl, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Hort Sci, Program Plant Cellular & Mol Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,,,"Rosenquist, Magnus/0000-0001-7795-9728",,,30,72,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4412,,DEC,2002,50,6,10.1023/A:1021289127519,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,620BN,WOS:000179513300014,12516868,,

In this study, each of the two genes from Colletotrichum fioriniae and C. nymphaeae was able to rescue the function of CYP51 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, demonstrating their independent function. Deletion of CYP51A led to increased sensitivity to propiconazole, diniconazole, prothioconazole, cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, flutriafol, prochloraz, and difenoconazole in C. fioriniae, and to the same fungicides and tebuconazole in C. nymphaeae, with the exception of prochloraz. Deletion of CYP51B in C. fioriniae and CYP51B in C. nymphaeae made mutants increasingly sensitive to five of nine DMI fungicides tested. The results suggest species-specific, differential binding of DMI fungicides onto the two CYP51 enzymes. Pairing DMIs with different effects on CYP51A and -B deletion mutants resulted in synergistic effects, as determined in mycelial growth inhibition experiments. Deletion mutants showed no fitness penalty in terms of mycelial growth, sporulation, and virulence. Our study elucidates the effect of CYP51A and CYP51B of Colletotrichum spp. on DMI sensitivity, suggesting that using a mixture of DMIs may improve the efficacy for anthracnose management.","[Chen, Shuning; Yang, Daibin; Yan, Xiaojing; Yuan, Huizhu] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops, Minist Agr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Hu, Mengjun] Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Schnabel, Guido] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",,"Yuan, HZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops, Minist Agr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,hzhyuan@ippcaas.cn,,"Hu, Mengjun/0000-0003-1567-0843","China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M630232]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFD0200107, 2019YFD1002003]","Project of the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant number 2018M630232), National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant number 2018YFD0200107), and National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant number 2019YFD1002003).",44,7,AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC,ST PAUL,"3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA",0031-949X,1943-7684,MAR,2020,110,3,10.1094/PHYTO-10-19-0385-R,Plant Sciences,KQ2PU,WOS:000516771400010,31799899,hybrid,

Few mutations associated with fungicide resistance were detected. No evidence for strobilurin resistance was found among 357 Tunisian isolates and only two among 80 sequenced isolates carried mutations associated with azole resistance. A network analysis suggested that these mutations emerged independently from mutations found in previously described European populations. The population genetic structure of M. graminicola in Tunisia was analyzed using variation at 11 microsatellite loci. Populations in Tunisia were characterized by high gene and genotype diversity. All populations were in gametic equilibrium and mating type proportions did not deviate from the 1:1 ratio expected under random mating, consistent with regular cycles of sexual reproduction. In combination with a high degree of gene flow among sampling sites, M. graminicola must be considered a pathogens with high evolutionary potential. Thus, control strategies against Septoria blotch in Tunisia should be optimized to reduce the emergence and spread of resistant isolates.","[McDonald, Bruce A.; Brunner, Patrick C.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Boukef, Sameh; Rezgui, Salah] Inst Natl Agron Tunisia, Lab Genet & Ameliorat Plantes, Tunis 1002, Tunisia; [Yahyaoui, Amor] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas, Aleppo, Syria",,"Brunner, PC (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",Switzerland,Europe,Global North,patrick.brunner@agrl.ethz.ch,"McDonald, Bruce A/A-2748-2008","McDonald, Bruce A/0000-0002-5332-2172",Swiss government through the Federal Commission for Scholarships (FCS) [20080384],"We thank Marcello Zala, Stefano Torriani, Megan McDonald and Joanna Bernardes de Assis for technical support and helpful discussions.

Demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides that target sterol 14 alpha-demethylase are an integral part of disease control. Here, we report six DMI-resistant isolates of Leptosphaeria maculans and two different types of genetic modification related to the resistance. Analysis of the regulatory region of the DMI target gene ERG11 (also known as CYP51) revealed a 275-bp insertion in two of the isolates and three long terminal repeat retrotransposons (5,263, 5.267, and 5,248 bp) inserted in the promoter region of three resistant isolates. Genetic approaches confirmed that these elements are responsible for DMI resistance in L. maculans and crosses show segregation consistent with a single locus. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR assays demonstrated that the 275-bp insertion increases ERG11 gene expression, conferring DMI fungicide resistance both in vitro and in planta. Moreover, transformation of a susceptible isolate of L. maculans with ERG11 driven by a promoter containing the 275-bp insertion increased resistance to tebuconazole. A minimal shift of the values of concentration whereby 50% of the mycelial growth is inhibited in vitro was observed in resistant isolates containing long terminal repeat retrotransposons; nevertheless, these isolates were able to develop significant lesions on cotyledons from fungicide-treated seedlings. This is the first report of genetic modifications in L. maculans relating to DMI fungicide resistance.","[Yang, Yongqing; Zhao, Ji] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Life Sci, Hohhot 010020, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yongqing; Van de Wouw, Angela P.; Idnurm, Alexander] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Yang, Yongqing; Li, Ziqin] Inner Mongolia Acad Agr & Anim Husb Sci, Hohhot 010031, Peoples R China; [Marcoft, Stephen J.] Marcroft Grains Pathol, Grains Innovat Pk, Horsham, Vic 3400, Australia; [Forsyth, Leanne M.] Syngenta Crop Protect, Macquarie Pk, N Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia",,"Van de Wouw, AP; Idnurm, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",Australia,Oceania,Global North,apvdw2@unimelb.edu.au; alexander.idnurm@unimelb.edu.au,"Van de Wouw, Angela/AAY-1163-2021; Idnurm, Alexander/AAC-9614-2019","Van de Wouw, Angela/0000-0001-5147-0393; Idnurm, Alexander/0000-0001-5995-7040; Marcroft, Steve/0000-0002-1339-2694; Yang, Yongqing/0000-0001-8478-5455",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Australian Grains Research and Development CorporationGrains R&D Corp; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, the Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation, and through an industry Linkage Project from the Australian Research Council.",52,3,AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC,ST PAUL,"3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA",0191-2917,1943-7692,MAY,2020,104,5,10.1094/PDIS-10-19-2088-RE,Plant Sciences,LK3BS,WOS:000530736500002,32202465,hybrid,

In this study, a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was developed to detect the Mona element. Fourteen DMI fungicide-resistant (DMI-R) and six DMI fungicide-sensitive (DMI-S) isolates from Georgia, six DMI-R and 11 DMI-S isolates from South Carolina, seven DMI-R and nine DMI-S isolates from New York, and two DMI-R and three DMI-S isolates from Ohio were used in this study. The isolates from the southeastern United States and Ohio were collected from peach, whereas isolates from New York were collected from cherry. A 376-bp fragment containing the Mona element was consistently amplified with primer pair INS65-F and INS65-R from DMI-R isolates, and either a 311-bp or 1,815-bp fragment was amplified from DMI-S isolates. The primer pair did not amplify DNA fragments of similar sizes from isolates of five other common fruit rot pathogens of peach, including Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum acutatum, Gilbertella persicaria, Penicillium expansum, and Rhizopus stolonifer. Gel electrophoresis of the PCR amplicon can distinguish between DMI-R and DMI-S isolates based on the 65-bp size difference of the amplicon; however, the restriction digestion assay can verify questionable results, especially in the absence of a positive control. Only the 376-bp fragment containing the Mona element was digestable with endonuclease BsrBI, resulting in two restriction fragments of 236 and 140 bp in size. In this study, a protocol for Mona detection from aerial fungal structures was developed that can yield results within a few hours of sampling. This study confirms that the Mona element is strongly linked to the DMI-resistance phenotype and reveals that overexpression of the MfCYP51 gene is a common DMI fungicide resistance mechanism in M. fructicola, not only in Georgia but throughout the eastern United States.","[Luo, Chao-Xi; Amiri, Achour; Schnabel, Guido] Clemson Univ, Dept Entomol Soils & Plant Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Cox, Kerik D.] Cornell Univ, New York State Agr Expt Stn, Dept Plant Pathol, Geneva, NY 14456 USA",,"Schnabel, G (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Entomol Soils & Plant Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,schnabe@clemson.edu,,,,,15,56,AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC,ST PAUL,"3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA",0191-2917,,JUL,2008,92,7,10.1094/PDIS-92-7-1099,Plant Sciences,315JD,WOS:000256873800016,30769523,hybrid,

Trichothecene genotypes of F. graminearum isolated from corn (n = 452) and wheat (n = 110) from 2010 to 2012 were identified. All the isolates were deoxynivalenol (DON) type. About 96% of corn isolates and 98% of wheat isolates were 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol (15ADON) type. The fungal population structures from corn (n = 313) and wheat (n = 73) were compared using 10 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers. The fungal populations and subpopulations categorized based on host, cultivar groups, years and geography showed high gene (H = 0.818-0.928) and genotypic (GD = 0.999-1.00) diversity. Gene flow was also high between corn and wheat population pairs (Nm = 8.212), and subpopulation pairs within corn (Nm = 7.13-23.614) or wheat (Nm = 19.483) populations. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates from both hosts were F. graminearum clade 7. These findings provide baseline data on 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol (3ADON) and 15ADON profiles of F. graminearum isolates from corn in Canada and are useful in evaluating mycotoxin contamination risks in corn and wheat grains.

In this study, the effect of KODA on flower production and spring shoot occurrence in mature satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.) trees was examined in the field. The application of KODA in the summer or autumn had no discernible effect on flower production in the following year. However, when applied in summer, it promoted spring shoot occurrence in the following year, regardless of the number of flowers produced. In addition, C-KODA, a KODA analog, was more effective at producing this effect than KODA. The results suggest that the application of KODA or C-KODA may regulate spring shoot occurrence to improve the imbalance between the number of flower-bearing and vegetative shoots that leads to alternate bearing in satsuma mandarin trees.","[Nakajima, Naoko; Ikoma, Yoshinori; Nakamura, Yuri] NARO Inst Fruit Tree Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058605, Japan; [Ikoma, Yoshinori; Matsumoto, Hikaru; Sato, Keiko] NARO Inst Fruit Tree Sci, Shimizu Ku, Shizuoka 4240292, Japan; [Yokoyama, Mineyuki; Ifuku, Ohji] Shiseido Co Ltd, Res Ctr, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368643, Japan; [Yoshida, Shigeo] RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Suehiro Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Nakamura, Yuri] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058517, Japan; [Yokoyama, Mineyuki] Yokohama City Univ, Kihara Inst Biol Res, Totsuka Ku, Maioka Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2440813, Japan",,"Nakajima, N (corresponding author), NARO Inst Fruit Tree Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058605, Japan.",Japan,Asia,Global North,nnaoko@affrc.go.jp,,"Matsumoto, Hikaru/0000-0002-6486-9237","Research and Development Program for New Bio-industry Initiatives, Japan","This work was supported by the Research and Development Program for New Bio-industry Initiatives, Japan.",,0,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,FEB,2016,51,2,10.21273/HORTSCI.51.2.141,Horticulture,,Agriculture,,gold,

DNA extracted from symptomatic and asymptomatic plants was used in nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with primers amplifying 16S rDNA sequences for phytoplasmas. Twenty-four percent of pepper and 49% of tomato samples yielded a nested rDNA product of 1.25 kb. Restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles and sequencing of PCR products allowed classification of the detected phytoplasmas with the aster yellows group (16SrI). Both phytoplasmas, pepper little leaf (PeLL) and tomato little leaf (ToLL), could be included as new members of the aster yellows group because HaeIII and TaqI restriction enzymes discriminated among these phytoplasmas and members of other 16SrI subgroups.

The 16SrIV-D phytoplasma was introduced to the state of Florida, United States; it has since caused severe economic losses to the green industries of Florida and is threating natural ecosystems because of its ability to infect the native palm Sabal palmetto. In this study, the genetic variability of the 16SrIV-D phytoplasma was assessed over a 10-year period to determine if multiple introductions had occurred or if natural mutations were occurring. Furthermore, the genetic variability of the palm lethal decline phytoplasma group (16SrIV) was assessed with a multiple locus analysis using the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region, and secA and groEL genes. Overall, no variability of the 16SrIV-D phytoplasma was documented in Florida over a 10-year period. The multilocus analysis showed support for three distinct species of the phytoplasma in the Caribbean basin that infect palms and further support that the 16SrIV-C from Tanzania is not closely related. Furthermore, 16SrIV-B and 16SrIV-D were found to be the same phytoplasma based on 100% identity between the two based on intergenic spacer region, secA, and groEL analysis.

The condition is characterized by an abnormal elongation of turfgrass stems and leaves that in rare cases progresses into a rapid and widespread necrosis and decline. Recent reports have cited bacteria, Acidovorax avenae and Xanthomonas translucens, as causal agents; however, few cases exist where either bacterium were isolated in conjunction with turf exhibiting bacterial disease symptoms. From 2010 to 2014, turfgrass from 62 locations submitted to the NC State Turf Diagnostic Clinic exhibiting bacterial etiolation and/or decline symptoms were sampled for the presence of bacterial pathogens. Isolated bacteria were identified using rRNA sequencing of the 16S subunit and internal transcribed spacer region (16S-23S or ITS). Results showed diverse bacteria isolated from symptomatic turf and A. avenae and X. translucens were only isolated in 26% of samples. Frequently isolated bacterial species were examined for pathogenicity to 4-week-old 'G2' CBG seedlings and 8-week-old 'A-1' CBG turfgrass stands in the greenhouse. While results confirmed pathogenicity of A. avenae and X. translucens, Pantoea ananatis was also shown to infect CBG turf; although pathogenicity varied among isolated strains. These results illustrate that multiple bacteria are associated with bacterial disease and shed new light on culturable bacteria living in CBG turfgrass putting greens. Future research to evaluate additional microorganisms (i.e., bacteria and fungi) could provide new information on host-microbe interactions and possibly develop ideas for management tactics to reduce turfgrass pests.","[Roberts, Joseph A.; Tredway, Lane P.; Ritchie, David F.; Kerns, James P.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Campus Box 7616,2510 Thomas Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Ma, Bangya] SePRO Corp, 16013 Watson Seed Farm Rd, Whitakers, NC 27891 USA; [Roberts, Joseph A.] Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, 2110 Plant Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,"Roberts, JA (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Campus Box 7616,2510 Thomas Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.; Roberts, JA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, 2110 Plant Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",USA,North America,Global North,robertsj@umd.edu,"Kerns, James/AAC-3208-2020","Kerns, James/0000-0002-1980-0126; Roberts, Joseph/0000-0002-4670-1860",United States Golf Association; Syngenta Crop ProtectionSyngenta,"We thank A.

Although many chloroplast mRNAs harbor putative SDs in their 59 untranslated regions and the aSD displays strong conservation, the functional relevance of SD-aSD interactions in plastid translation is unclear. Here, by generating transplastomic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mutants with point mutations in the aSD coupled with genome-wide analysis of translation by ribosome profiling, we provide a global picture of SD-dependent translation in plastids. We observed a pronounced correlation between weakened predicted SD-aSD interactions and reduced translation efficiency. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the strength of the SD-aSD interaction is not the only determinant of the translational output of many plastid mRNAs. Finally, the translation efficiency of mRNAs with strong secondary structures around the start codon is more dependent on the SD-aSD interaction than weakly structured mRNAs. Thus, our data reveal the importance of the aSD in plastid translation initiation, uncover chloroplast genes whose translation is influenced by SD-aSD interactions, and provide insights into determinants of translation efficiency in plastids.","[Scharff, Lars B.; Ehrnthaler, Miriam; Janowski, Marcin; Childs, Liam H.; Hasse, Claudia; Gremmels, Juergen; Ruf, Stephanie; Zoschke, Reimo; Bock, Ralph] Max Planck Inst Mol Pflanzenphysiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Scharff, Lars B.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Copenhagen Plant Sci Ctr, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Childs, Liam H.] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Theoret Bioinformat, Berliner Str 41, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",,"Bock, R (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Mol Pflanzenphysiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",Germany,Europe,Global North,rbock@mpimp-golm.mpg.de,"Scharff, Lars B/A-8017-2015; Bock, Ralph/B-4352-2009; Scharff, Lars/AAU-6664-2020; Zoschke, Reimo/AAH-1398-2021; Ruf, Stephanie/AAW-8311-2020","Scharff, Lars B/0000-0003-0210-3428; Bock, Ralph/0000-0001-7502-6940; Scharff, Lars/0000-0003-0210-3428; Ruf, Stephanie/0000-0002-9469-5944; Childs, Liam/0000-0002-2080-1804; Zoschke, Reimo/0000-0002-6898-6836","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 2092, BO 1482/17-1, SFB-TR 175, ZO 302/4-1]; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society","We thank Michael Tillich for help with microarray design, Ines Gerlach (both from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology) for excellent technical assistance, and Maxim Ivanov (Copenhagen Plant Science Centre, University of Copenhagen) for providing scripts.

However, few insights discussed endophytes' role in Ginkgo, and whether genetic exchange happens between Ginkgo and endophytes remains unclear. Herein, functional gene profiles and repetitive sequences were analyzed to focus on these issues. A total of 25 endophyte strains were isolated from the Ginkgo root and distributed in 16 genera of 6 phyla. Significant morphological diversities lead to the diversity in the COG functional classification. KEGG mapping revealed that endophytic bacteria and fungi potentially synthesize chalcone, while endophytic fungi might also promote flavonoid derivatization. Both bacteria and fungi may facilitate the lignin synthesis. Aspergillus sp. Gbtc_1 exhibited the feasibility of regulating alcohols to lignans. Although Ginkgo and the endophytes have not observed the critical levopimaradiene synthase in ginkgolides synthesis, the upstream pathways of terpenoid precursors are likely intact. The MVK genes in Ginkgo may have alternative non-homologous copies or be compensated by endophytes in long-term symbiosis. Cellulomonas sp. Gbtc_1 became the only bacteria to harbor both MEP and MVA pathways. Endophytes may perform the mutual transformation of IPP and DMAPP in the root. Ginkgo and bacteria may lead to the synthesis and derivatization of the carotenoid pathway. The isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis seemed lost in the Ginkgo root community, but L-dopa is more probably converted into dopamine as an essential signal-transduction substance. So, endophytes may participate in the secondary metabolism of the Ginkgo in a shared or complementary manner. Moreover, a few endophytic sequences predicted as Ty3/Gypsy and Ty1/Copia superfamilies exhibited extremely high similarity to those of Ginkgo. CDSs in such endophytic LTR-RT sequences were also highly homologous to one Ginkgo CDS. Therefore, LTR-RTs may be a rare unit flowing between the Ginkgo host and endophytes to exchange genetic information. Collectively, this research effectively expanded the insight on the symbiotic relationship between the Ginkgo host and the endophytes in the root.","[Zou, Kai; Liu, Xueduan; Fu, Shaodong; Zhang, Shuangfei; Huang, Haonan; Lei, Fangying; Zhang, Guoqing; Miao, Bo; Meng, Delong; Jiang, Luhua; Liu, Hongwei; Yin, Huaqun; Liang, Yili] Cent South Univ, Sch Minerals Proc & Bioengn, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Zou, Kai; Liu, Xueduan; Fu, Shaodong; Zhang, Shuangfei; Huang, Haonan; Lei, Fangying; Zhang, Guoqing; Miao, Bo; Meng, Delong; Jiang, Luhua; Liu, Hongwei; Yin, Huaqun; Liang, Yili] Minist Educ, Key Lab Biomet, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qi] NEOMICS Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Du] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Shenzhen Agr Genome Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",,"Liang, YL (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Minerals Proc & Bioengn, Changsha, Peoples R China.; Liang, YL (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Biomet, Changsha, Peoples R China.",China,Asia,Global South,liangyili6@csu.edu.cn,,,"Chinese National Science and Technology Support Program [2013BAC09B00]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [302001124, 31570113]; Graduate Research and Innovation Project in Central South University, China [1053320170629]","This work was supported by the following grants: Chinese National Science and Technology Support Program (2013BAC09B00), National Natural Science Foundation of China (302001124 and 31570113), and Graduate Research and Innovation Project (1053320170629) in Central South University, China.",139,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,9-Jul,2021,12,,10.3389/fpls.2021.704985,Plant Sciences,TP1YU,WOS:000677394300001,34305992,"Green Published, gold",Gold

Polymerase chain reaction assays were carried out using DNA extracted from leaves of each species for the detection of the presence of phytoplasmas. Only samples of Clematis vitalba were found to be infected with phytoplasmas. Restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing data of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and of a non-ribosomal DNA fragment FD9 revealed that the phytoplasma isolate was identical to that causing FD in the nearby vineyard. The isolate identified in the clematis is the same as the FD-C phytoplasma found in grapevine in north-east Italy.,"Ist Sperimentale Viticoltura, I-31015 Conegliano, TV, Italy",,"Angelini, E (corresponding author), Ist Sperimentale Viticoltura, Viale 28 Aprile 26, I-31015 Conegliano, TV, Italy.",Italy,Europe,Global North,isvbd@libero.it,,,,,,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0929-1873,1573-8469,FEB,2004,110,2,10.1023/B:EJPP.0000015361.95661.37,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Horticulture,,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,,,

During 2010, samples from several apple trees displaying proliferation symptoms were collected throughout the Czech Republic to verify identity of phytoplasmas detected in association with the disease. The majority of the 74 apple trees examined using molecular tools were positive for 'Ca. P. mali' presence. The 16S-23S ribosomal genes, the ribosomal protein genes and the nitroreductase and rhodonase like genes were then studied to verify phytoplasma strain variability on multigenic bases. Two RFLP profiles and correspondingly two genetic lineages were found in the PCR-amplified fragments covering the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region. 'Ca. P. mali' strains belonging to rpX-A subgroup were identified in the majority of the apple tree sampled, whereas phytoplasmas belonging to the rpX-B subgroup were distributed sporadically. The apple proliferation subtypes AP-15 and AT-2 exhibited nearly equal occurrence; the AT-1 subtype and a mixture of the two or all three of the AP subtypes were infrequently found. The PCR/RFLP results were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analyses of selected 'Ca. P. mali' strains.","[Franova, Jana] ASCR, Ctr Biol, Dept Plant Virol, Inst Plant Mol Biol,Vvi, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Ludvikova, Hana; Paprstein, Frantisek] Res & Breeding Inst Pomol, Holovousy V Podkrkonosi 50801, Horice, Czech Republic; [Bertaccini, Assunta] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, DipSA, I-40127 Bologna, Italy",,"Franova, J (corresponding author), ASCR, Ctr Biol, Dept Plant Virol, Inst Plant Mol Biol,Vvi, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",Czech Republic,Europe,Global North,jana@umbr.cas.cz,"Franova, Jana/G-9470-2014","Franova, Jana/0000-0001-8451-1454; Bertaccini, Assunta/0000-0002-5650-1512","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [OC09021, LD12074]; [RVO:60077344]","The work was supported by grant of Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic No. OC09021 (Cost Action 864), and No. LD12074 (Cost Action FA0807) and the institutional support RVO:60077344.
